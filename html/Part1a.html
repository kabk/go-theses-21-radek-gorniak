  <h1>PART 1: The History</h1>

  <blockquote>
  <p>When we speak of ‘history’, when we view events from a historical perspective, we are imposing a certain modulation of our perception and projection of time. Historical perception shapes time into an all-encompassing dimension that forces individuals and groups to share their temporalities according to a uniform meter and a teleological (or economic) frame. People enter the historical domain when they all hear more or less the same music in their ears.—F. Bernardi <sup><a href="#fn2-9219" id="fnr2-9219" title="see footnote" class="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

  <h2>Middle Point</h2>

  <p>What do we understand by saying &quot;Middle Ages&quot;? Usually, the period that falls roughly between the years 300 and 1500 A.D., stuck between the apparent wonders of the ancient cultures of Greece and Rome, and the classical rationale reborn in the European renaissance. It is stereotyped as a period of stagnation and misery. It’s in the name itself – the “Dark” Ages, or the ”medieval”, from the Latin <em>medium aevum</em>, a “Middle Age”<sup><a href="#fn3-9219" id="fnr3-9219" title="see footnote" class="footnote">3</a></sup>. While a “Dark Age” describes the period quite clearly in a negative light, the “Middle” goes beyond that—it suggests that it is a moment only defined by more notable things that have happened before, and have come afterwards.</p>

  <p>In his book <em>Medieval Bodies</em>, art historian Jack Hartnell, who, by his own definition, deals with revealing the Middle Ages from its warped impression, brings up a public survey done by a major London museum. The visitors were asked to imagine themselves living in the Medieval and Renaissance periods, and describe what they might have felt or seen. As expected, people responded positively to the Renaissance: </p>

  <blockquote>
  <p>I’m in Florence walking by the river at midday. It’s peaceful, I’m smiling. I’m an artist’s model and he’s sculpting the Madonna and Child. The sunshine sparkles, there’s a little glade and a little lake. There’s philosophy, people sitting round talking about politics, books. Music … I want to stay and dream.
  </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>In a stark contrast, ideas about the Middle Ages were rather bleak:
  </p>

  <blockquote>
  <p>There are soldiers, peasants, high castles, muddy lowlands … Black Death and Plague are all around. It’s raining. People are drunk on mead and fighting among themselves. The artists are not respected. I’m in a dungeon wearing a potato sack and it’s night. It’s cold, there are rats. The windows have bars at floor level. I stole some potatoes for your newborn child.” <sup><a href="#fn4-9219" id="fnr4-9219" title="see footnote" class="footnote">4</a></sup> </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Here we can see how stereotypes of historical periods are disconnected from the reality of place (we are always in Florence), the elements (it’s always raining), and history itself (potatoes came to Europe only from America in 1570).</p>

  <p>There are two main reasons to justify describing the period as &quot;Dark&quot;. One would be a small amount of written records in the Early Middle Ages. The other is an apparent loss of Classical Greek texts, which were in fact preserved outside of Europe.</p>

  <p>Understanding Middle Ages is the problem not only of the time, in terms of agreeing on specific time boundaries, but also of space—while a lot of assumptions about the time are (western) Euro-centric, Jack Hartnell argues that it should be rather seen as a period of intense interaction (both positive and negative), between the inheritors of the legacy of the Roman Empire: the emerging European states, the Byzantine Empire, and the Islamic World.<sup><a href="#fn5-9219" id="fnr5-9219" title="see footnote" class="footnote">5</a></sup></p>

  <p>Maps of the world reflected this – showing the structure of the world as a connection of Africa, Asia and Europe, with Jerusalem (or sometimes Constantinople) in the middle, as the <em>axis mundi</em>, or the central axis of the world. </p>

  <p>While the viewpoint on the period was maintained by the so-called rational reformers that came later in history, it might have its origins in the Late Medieval period. The Italian author Francesco Petrarch, considered to be one of the earliest thinkers of the Renaissance, wrote around 1350 in his <em>‌Epistolae familiares</em>: </p>

  <blockquote>
  <p>“There was a more fortunate age and probably there will be one again; in the middle, in our time, you see the confluence of wretches and ignominy… &quot; <sup><a href="#fn6-9219" id="fnr6-9219" title="see footnote" class="footnote">6</a></sup></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>He later expanded on his dark and edgy views in his grand poem <em>Africa</em>:</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p>&quot;My fate is to live among varied and confusing storms. But for you perhaps, if, as I hope and wish, you will live long after me, there will follow a better age. When the darkness has been dispersed, our descendants can come again into the former pure radiance.” <sup><a href="#fn7-9219" id="fnr7-9219" title="see footnote" class="footnote">7</a></sup></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Seeing how much his sentiment resonates with me in connection to our time, I do wonder if some comparisons could be drawn between ours and Petrarch’s times. Or, as he was a great scholar of Cicero (a writer from Ancient Rome), perhaps it is a common feeling to have, when looking into history of periods that have passed.</p>
