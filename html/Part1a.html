  <h1>THE HISTORY</h1>

  <blockquote class="big_quote">
  When we speak of ‘history’, when we view events from a historical perspective, we are imposing a certain modulation of our perception and projection of time. Historical perception shapes time into an all-encompassing dimension that forces individuals and groups to share their temporalities according to a uniform meter and a teleological (or economic) frame. People enter the historical domain when they all hear more or less the same music in their ears.—F. Bernardi <sup><a href="#fn2-9219" id="fnr2-9219" title="see footnote" class="footnote">2</a></sup>
  </blockquote>

  <h2>Middle Point</h2>

  <p>What do we understand by saying &quot;Middle Ages&quot;? Usually, the period that falls roughly between the years 300 and 1500 A.D., stuck between the apparent wonders of the ancient cultures of Greece and Rome, and the classical rationale reborn in the European renaissance. It is stereotyped as a period of stagnation and misery. It’s in the name itself – the “Dark” Ages, or the ”medieval”, from the Latin <em>medium aevum</em>, a “Middle Age”<sup><a href="#fn3-9219" id="fnr3-9219" title="see footnote" class="footnote">3</a></sup>. While a “Dark Age” describes the period quite clearly in a negative light, the “Middle” goes beyond that—it suggests that it is a moment only defined by more notable things that have happened before, and have come afterwards.</p>

  <p>In his book <em>Medieval Bodies</em>, art historian Jack Hartnell, who, by his own definition, deals with revealing the Middle Ages from its warped impression, brings up a public survey done by a major London museum. The visitors were asked to imagine themselves living in the Medieval and Renaissance periods, and describe what they might have felt or seen. As expected, people responded positively to the Renaissance: </p>

  <blockquote>
  <p>I’m in Florence walking by the river at midday. It’s peaceful, I’m smiling. I’m an artist’s model and he’s sculpting the Madonna and Child. The sunshine sparkles, there’s a little glade and a little lake. There’s philosophy, people sitting round talking about politics, books. Music … I want to stay and dream.
  </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>In a stark contrast, ideas about the Middle Ages were rather bleak:
  </p>

  <blockquote>
  <p>There are soldiers, peasants, high castles, muddy lowlands … Black Death and Plague are all around. It’s raining. People are drunk on mead and fighting among themselves. The artists are not respected. I’m in a dungeon wearing a potato sack and it’s night. It’s cold, there are rats. The windows have bars at floor level. I stole some potatoes for your newborn child.” <sup><a href="#fn4-9219" id="fnr4-9219" title="see footnote" class="footnote">4</a></sup> </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Here we can see how stereotypes of historical periods are disconnected from the reality of place (we are always in Florence), the elements (it’s always raining), and history itself (potatoes came to Europe only from America in 1570).</p>

  <p>There are two main reasons to justify describing the period as &quot;Dark&quot;. One would be a small amount of written records in the Early Middle Ages. The other is an apparent loss of Classical Greek texts, which were in fact preserved outside of Europe.</p>

  <p>Understanding Middle Ages is the problem not only of the time, in terms of agreeing on specific time boundaries, but also of space—while a lot of assumptions about the time are (western) Euro-centric, Jack Hartnell argues that it should be rather seen as a period of intense interaction (both positive and negative), between the inheritors of the legacy of the Roman Empire: the emerging European states, the Byzantine Empire, and the Islamic World.<sup><a href="#fn5-9219" id="fnr5-9219" title="see footnote" class="footnote">5</a></sup></p>

  <p>Maps of the world reflected this – showing the structure of the world as a connection of Africa, Asia and Europe, with Jerusalem (or sometimes Constantinople) in the middle, as the <em>axis mundi</em>, or the central axis of the world. </p>

  </figure>

  <p>While the viewpoint on the period was maintained by the so-called rational reformers that came later in history, it might have its origins in the Late Medieval period. The Italian author Francesco Petrarch, considered to be one of the earliest thinkers of the Renaissance, wrote around 1350 in his <em>‌Epistolae familiares</em>: </p>

  <blockquote>
  <p>“There was a more fortunate age and probably there will be one again; in the middle, in our time, you see the confluence of wretches and ignominy… &quot; <sup><a href="#fn6-9219" id="fnr6-9219" title="see footnote" class="footnote">6</a></sup></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>He later expanded on his dark and edgy views in his grand poem <em>Africa</em>:</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p>&quot;My fate is to live among varied and confusing storms. But for you perhaps, if, as I hope and wish, you will live long after me, there will follow a better age. When the darkness has been dispersed, our descendants can come again into the former pure radiance.” <sup><a href="#fn7-9219" id="fnr7-9219" title="see footnote" class="footnote">7</a></sup></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Seeing how much his sentiment resonates with me in connection to our time, I do wonder if some comparisons could be drawn between ours and Petrarch’s times. Or, as he was a great scholar of Cicero (a writer from Ancient Rome), perhaps it is a common feeling to have, when looking into history of periods that have passed.</p>

  <h2>Theory of Seeing</h2>

  <p>To better understand what are the Medieval afterimages, I would like to start at the beginning, that is, in the middle, and briefly look at the visual source material from the time, with a little help from an expert. </p>

  <p>Personally, I have been drawn to the period because of the many contradictions that surround it. Having the “middle” infamy, despite, as I found out, being a quite clear beginning of the way modern European states are shaped, marking the appearance of the first universities, and establishing a strong tradition in the use of reason. However, it still retains a certain strangeness and &quot;darkness&quot;. I think that contradiction is best seen in visual art from the period.</p>

  <p>On one hand, we can observe gold decorated manuscripts, rich tapestries, monumental churches. On the other, I can’t help but laugh at the crude and symbolic compositions with an almost non existent perspective, especially baffling when keeping in mind the preceding hellenistic paintings and the succeeding renaissance ones. Looking at them today, it's difficult to determine what was done as a joke, or did people back then really believe that knights fought snails, and men, whose heads did grow beneath their shoulders, roamed the Earth. It has been a long-unanswered mystery for me. </p>

  </figure>

  <p>While I don't think there's a simple, hidden answer for that question, I have gained a better understanding for why was Medieval art the way it was. The biggest help in that process has been <em>Theory of Seeing</em>, a book by Władysław Strzemiński, which I found precious not only because of showing art history in an atypical manner, but also it being available only in Polish. Because of that, and because his line of reasoning is confusing at best, I will try to slowly explain the general idea. </p>

  <p>I love off-topic backstories to a fault, so here's one: Władysław Strzemiński (1893–1952) was a polymath in a true sense go the word—he had a technical engineering education, he was a successful avant-garde painter (he studied under Kazimir Malevich), and at the end of his life, he was a prominent professor at the art academy in Łódź. On top of that, he developed an interest in the physical aspects of eyesight, mainly because of World War I injuries he suffered. <em>Theory of Seeing</em> was supposed to combine all of those interests into one work, but in a typical fashion of a Polish tragedy, he passed away after World War II, ostracised by the communist establishment, before fully completing the book. <sup><a href="#fn8-9219" id="fnr8-9219" title="see footnote" class="footnote">8</a></sup></p>

  <p>At the beginning of the book, Strzemiński starts simple enough, by looking at art history not as an isolated process, but in close connection to societal structures, technological advancements and other historical turmoils. He states that since ancient civilisations have formed, our actual eyesight, in a biological sense, has not evolved.<sup><a href="#fn9-9219" id="fnr9-9219" title="see footnote" class="footnote">9</a></sup> Yet, we can observe a growing visual awareness in how eyesight was used, in arts, throughout history: starting with contour vision of the paleolit, through silhouette vision, to the perspective discoveries of the renaissance. He accentuates that our notions of realism in art have changed, and that the process of a growing visual awareness is a reflection of historical progress.<sup><a href="#fn10-9219" id="fnr10-9219" title="see footnote" class="footnote">10</a></sup></p>

  <p>In a way, it sounds very obvious. Yes, art did become more complex as civilisations became more developed. But, by framing art history not only as styles that just &quot;happened&quot; in a vacuum, Strzemiński creates interesting connections. </p>

  <p>For example, he explains why in so many cultures we can observe a transformation from free-form linear drawings<sup><a href="#fn11-9219" id="fnr11-9219" title="see footnote" class="footnote">11</a></sup> (think cave drawings) into monumental, rhythmical and ornamental art. The common element in these cultures, such as Egypt, Mesopotamia, Peru and India, was a close relationship to controlling water sources, as well as the supremacy of the priesthood caste. Their dependency on calendars to predict flooding and optimal harvest times, as well as keeping complex irrigation systems required strict and competent governance.<sup><a href="#fn12-9219" id="fnr12-9219" title="see footnote" class="footnote">12</a></sup></p>

  <figure>
  <img src="../images/Narmer_Palette_serpopard_side.jpg" alt="the Narmer Palette" />
  <figcaption><em>the Narmer Palette</em></figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>Let's look at a visual example from Ancient Egypt: the Narmer Palette, dated to be around 5000 years old. Looking at one of its sides, we can clearly see the king, the representative of priesthood rule. Standing below the heads of gods, not only is his silhouette is the biggest one, but also the most unique one, with a crown on his head, and symbols of power in his hands. All other human beings, especially his decapitated victims, are repeated and devoid of personality, reflecting the structure of society in Egypt.</p>

  <p>The madman Strzemiński goes further. In order to explain some of the pattern-like, rhythmical qualities of ancient art, he introduces the concept of &quot;architectonisation&quot;: a process of connecting shapes of objects across mediums, and creating a rhythmical relationship between them. Sculpture and pottery. Architecture and painting.<sup><a href="#fn13-9219" id="fnr13-9219" title="see footnote" class="footnote">13</a></sup></p>

  <p>It gets even better: as before, Strzemiński doesn't look at this process as something disconnected from reality of being, and reality of seeing. For him, a reason for such fluid &quot;spilling&quot; of forms and shapes across objects, is the phenomenon of the afterimage. Having a pattern burned into your retina for a few seconds, and then seeing it again in a different object makes you feel harmony, makes you feel beauty.<sup><a href="#fn14-9219" id="fnr14-9219" title="see footnote" class="footnote">14</a></sup> </p>

  <figcaption>Columns of the Doric order at the Parthenon, Athens</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>So, how does it all connect to Medieval art? </p>

  <p>When describing the Middle Ages, at first Strzemiński points out the apparent: the seeming ‘fall’ of civilisation with the decline of the Hellenic Roman-Greek culture. Looking at it today, we might view the Late Hellenic art as 'realistic': it used three-dimensional perspective, and subtly complex colours, usually to show material qualities of commodities.<sup><a href="#fn15-9219" id="fnr15-9219" title="see footnote" class="footnote">15</a></sup></p>

  <p>When the Medieval age rolled in, the continuity of progression in art has been broken. In some areas, the Romanesque art of Northern and Central Europe regressed to primitive silhouette art, or even at times line art, which corresponds with the art of the early Ancient Egypt, with around 4000 years of difference in between.<sup><a href="#fn16-9219" id="fnr16-9219" title="see footnote" class="footnote">16</a></sup></p>

  <p>Staying on the level of a formal analysis (ie. one that analyses only the elements of the form), it can be said that both art of the Middle Ages and Ancient Egypt uses “intentional perspective”, where scale of an individual represents their importance in the social hierarchy (like in the earlier example of the Narmer Palette).<sup><a href="#fn17-9219" id="fnr17-9219" title="see footnote" class="footnote">17</a></sup> But to explain why the societies of Early Middle Ages also used that perspective, Strzemiński goes away from formal analysis and back to his definition of visual awareness: as a reflection of reality of a given point in time, that a given society reached at that point. </p>

  <p>So, similarities should be looked for also in structures of societies: after the fall of the Roman Empire, Medieval Europe was ruled by the priesthood class, similar to early Antiquity.</p>

  <p>Architectonisation, the transfer of shapes through afterimage, also makes a comeback. In both Romanesque and Byzantine art the square serves as the often repeated element, the base for architectural constructions and painting compositions.<sup><a href="#fn18-9219" id="fnr18-9219" title="see footnote" class="footnote">18</a></sup></p>

  <p>But, to make a bold statement, Middle Ages were not the Antiquity, despite the initial similarities. Before, it took thousands of years to come from silhouette drawings to the Hellenic perspective. This time, it took a few hundred years at most. Instead of thinking of the Medieval period as a &quot;dead&quot; one, Strzemiński argues that it was one of the most accelerated periods of reconstructing society on top of a new, feudal structure. <sup><a href="#fn19-9219" id="fnr19-9219"   title="see footnote" class="footnote">19</a></sup></p>


    <h2>Living History</h2>

    <h3>Afterimages in surroundings</h3>

    <p>As I found out during the research for this text, by starting to dig into history you can almost never stop with following a thread back and back through time. Still, it has become clear for me how the Middle Ages period seems to be the cradle of today’s Europe, the region that has been physically and culturally my home. Understanding that period better has helped to understand the state of affairs today. </p>

    <p>Its afterimage is still visible today. It was the period that established Christian dominance in the region. While in countries like the Netherlands or Germany its strong influence is well hidden under secular statehoods, in countries like Poland, where I'm from, it is much more direct.</p>

    <p>I remember very well from history lessons that the moment considered to be the beginning of the history of Poland was its baptism in 966 A.D. Almost over a 1000 years later, it was still seen as a moment defining the whole country’s identity. Throughout many dynasties, political systems and hostile invasions, Christianity is portrayed as the stable element throughout history. Despite being theoretically a secular state, you can observe the crucifix in most state organisations, courts and schools. </p>

    <p>Apart from Christian elements, I was able to observe many Medieval afterimages during my internship period in Berlin, for example conducting extensive research on the long tradition of local German beers. Here, blackletter typography and labels that refer to old guild emblems are supposed to give the product a sense of historical legitimacy. Similarly, across many European cities we can still observe coats of arms, flags, or different heraldic symbols with that refer to the Medieval past. For example, Berlin’s coat of arms is a black bear, a symbol that can be traced back almost 800 years back. </p>

    <p>Being in Berlin also helped me to use the cities resources available, and visit local archives and libraries.</p>

    <h3>Liber Chronicarum</h3>

    <p>On the 30th of October 2020, the last possible day before it was closed off to non-university users, I managed to reserve a time slot in the library of the Humboldt University in Berlin. It’s an impressive building, funnily enough called the Jacob-und-Wilhelm-Grimm-Zentrum. When I used to study Architecture, I remember staring for hours at the photographs of its grand reading room, accentuated by a square construction grid, with a void space that spans 5 floors. And I finally ended up here, in the strangest circumstances. After a bit of back and forth with the reception, regarding my lack of necessary library cards, I arrived at the 6th floor (above the void-reading room), in the Historical Collections room. Even before going in, I already had a feeling that I shouldn’t be there, that I was trespassing in some secret governmental archive. It was hard to believe that I was let inside, just thanks to a few e-mails, and no money taken from me. Being so used to having to pay for everything, even for some of the PDFs that I have read for writing this text, it feels very strange to be able to see such important cultural artefacts, entirely for free.</p>

    <p>I had requested to see a copy of the Nurnberg Chronicle, a “compendium of universal history”, a brainchild of Hartmann Schedel, a doctor in Nurnberg. It is one of the most densely illustrated and technically advanced works of early printing. It is also notable for having one of the first woodcuts made by Albrecht Dürer. The specific copy that I was able to see has been printed in 1493, merely 50 years after Johannes Gutenberg started using movable type for printing. After the necessary clearances and preparations, I was able to look through the book freely, spending as much time as I saw fit.</p>

    <p>Seeing the book in front of my eyes, made me notice completely different things than looking at scans on the screen, even the high quality ones. First of all, the size of it makes a big difference—each page is about A3, or even bigger in size. That made me less focused on the spread as a singe image, but instead I started reading it as a collection of elements, often quite well detailed. For example, looking at the scans on the screen I would never have noticed that while the text is set with movable type (you can see repeated letter forms), the lettering in the woodcuts is custom made, and a part of the illustration. </p>

    <figure>
    <img src="../images/IMG_3191.JPG" alt="" />
    </figure>

    <p>Each woodcut became a collection of lines, which immediately de-mystified the book for me, instead of some strange, other worldly object, it became something that a human being could actually produce. </p>

    <p>Not that it made the thing less impressive, or diminished its importance for me. Touching the paper from 600 years ago, even if through the gloves (that is until the lady at the desk looked somewhere else), can be only a spiritual experience.</p>

    <p>Having the book in front of me, all to my disposal, in a highly guarded building, wearing white gloves made me think of a coroner about to conduct an autopsy. Or rather, of a scholar of the arcane, about to unravel some awesome secret. There were no websites to summarise and categorise the object, no descriptions to skew my interpretation, no experts to guide my attention. The only “facts” I could rely on was the knowledge I already had, and the empirical observations that I could conduct. </p>

    <p>The thing that has been de-mystified the most for me, was the books purpose, or rather the bulk of its contents. In the end, after an introduction that describes the creation of the world (which of course is based on the Bible, apparently the did not hear about the “rational” Renaissance being around the corner), most of the book is actually a description of cities in the Holy Roman Empire, and the noble families that had lived in them.</p>

    <p>At the end of the book, I stumbled upon Wrocław, the city in Poland that I was born in. Seeing it in such an old account made me full realise that history did, in fact, happen. By holding history in my hands, it stopped being a vague annoyance preached by teachers in schools, but an actual cycle of generations, existing for hundred thousand years before me. </p>

    <img src="../images/IMG_8269.JPG" alt="" />
    </figure>

    <p>Coming from a country with an eroded sense of continuity, and having lived in many different places myself, it becomes even more important to find such a proof of historical legitimacy, as a counter to the liquid modernity of today.

    Feeling a rush of excitement, I wanted to see more artefacts, while still in Berlin. Using the Nurnberg Chronicle as a starting point, I have gone to the Kupferstichkabinett, the Museum of Prints and Drawings in Berlin, to see original prints of Albrecht Dürer.</p>

    <p>Again, seeing how important it is to see things in the flesh, or in the paper, felt like coming out of a long coma, and re-learning things that I knew well before. It is such a basic thing, it is easy for me to forget. It felt like a glass wall of the screen has been lifted in front of my eyes. A curtain lifted, transforming an image I was seeing as only that, an image, into a collection of exposed elements, ready for me to interpret. </p>

    <p>The way I look at things, and the way my focus works, makes me rarely look beyond what I am seeing. I rarely analyse and interpret things on my own. Usually the form of an image is what interests me, not its meaning. </p>

    <p>I think it’s interesting to look at Albrecht Dürer’s work, and other examples of the early printmaking, because of their existence on the border of the Medieval and the Renaissance periods. I could definitely see a difference in quality of his image-making, when comparing his earliest works I’ve seen (Nurnberg Chronicle) and latest (Melancholia). I would argue that his early works are an example of Medieval methodology, while using Renaissance technology. Apart from Melancholia, I've seen prints from Dürer's <em>Apocalypse</em> – a popular topic at the time, as people believed that we world would end in the year 1500. (The Nurnberg Chronicle itself has empty pages left at the end, for people to record the last years of the universe).</p>

    <p>In comparison to my previous viewing, the Dürer prints were presented to me as single sheets, in a cardboard passepartout. No one in the building really spoke English, but I was able to communicate with a mix of basic German and English, as I had to receive detailed instructions how to handle the artworks. After signing some paperwork regarding the rights to the pictures I have taken, I was left all by myself with the drawings. Just me and Dürer. With the prints sitting on a small wooden easel, it felt like I was visiting an old friend locked away in prison. </p>

    <figure>
    <img src="../images/IMG_7062.JPG" alt="" />
    </figure>

    <p>The first one I viewed was <em>Saint Michael Fighting the Dragon</em>, from The Apocalypse. At the beginning, I was simply amazed by the quality of the artwork, and overwhelmed by the fact of seeing the print in front of me, in my hand’s reach. After viewing the rest, I returned to it, to analyse it better. Because of my perverse interests in letters, the first thing to have caught my attention was Dürer’s famous composite monogram, sitting at the bottom. </p>

    <figure>
    <img src="../images/IMG_7065.JPG" alt="" />
    </figure>

    <p>Otherwise, the first thing to catch my attention is the spear the Angel uses to strike the dragon, because of its remarkably white and unlined appearance, tearing diagonally through the page.</p>

    <p>Despite the print showing such an action-packed scene, about 1/5 of the composition is dedicated to showing the surrounding landscape, which can tell us something about Dürer’s environment and the values important to him.</p>

    <p>First thing to notice, is most of the landscape is still natural. Apart from that, we see: a city (it’s safe to assume it’s representing Nurnberg, or at least Nurnberg was the model), so: city state as the core element of civilisation. Next to the city, we see two ships on a lake, going to what seems to be another, far-off settlement. So, trade, as a way of communicating and exchanging with the rest of the world. Next, in the city and just outside of it, we see two church towers. Next to the protective city walls, the presence of churches is on of the most visible elements of the man-made landscape.</p>

    <p>Despite the scene being biblical, we are able to see the structure of Dürer’s world: a network of well-guarded cities of Nürnberg, Koln, Bern, etc.</p>

    <p>The next print I have seen were the <em>‌The Four Horsemen</em>. Admittedly, I wasn't so up to date on my Bible knowledge – I always preferred fantasy that kept up an earnest distance to it being fictional. So I wasn't immediately sure what I was looking at. But, by analysing what we can see in the image, we can see what Dürer is trying to communicate. Each of the riders is carrying a different weapon, which is surely not accidental. While just by looking, three of the horsemen could be read as heroic characters – but the fourth one odd, clearly sticking out from the rest in the composition as well as in his menacing look, suggest a sinister side of the group, which in the connection to the Apocalypse, made me realise I'm looking at the Four Horsemen.</p>

    <figure>
    <img src="../images/DP816773.jpg" alt="" />
    </figure>

    <p>The third print I've seen, was <em>‌The Vision of the Seven</em> Candlesticks. Here, Dürer again leaves a lot of visual clues. St. Johns kneeling position, clasped hands and bare feet suggest his submission to the almighty God, of course shown as an old, wise man. Everywhere we see the symbolism of number seven, important in the Apocalypse. Apart from his place in the composition, and an authoritative seated position, it is worth noting what are the visible symbols of God's power: eyes surrounded by fire, 7 stars surrounding his right hand, a sword sticking out of his mouth and a book in the left hand.</p>

    <p>The last print I have seen, <em>Melancholy</em>, marks the shift into the early Renaissance, both visually and thematically. At this point, Dürer refined his woodcut line work into an absurd point, achieving much more 'realistic' (for our eyes) rendering. The melancholic figure is surrounded by symbols that refer to &quot;liberal arts&quot;: grammar, logic, rhetoric, mathematics, music, astronomy.<sup><a href="#fn20-9219" id="fnr20-9219" title="see footnote" class="footnote">20</a></sup></p>
