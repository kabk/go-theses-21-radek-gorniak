  <h2>Letters and signifiers</h2>

  <p>After being in kindergarten, when Pokemon ruled, I didn’t have many common interest with other kids when growing up. Not having much athletic talent, I also wasn’t very interested in football. That, combined with growing up in a non-Christian household meant missing out from the most common topics that kids were talking about, football and first communion. I found refuge in books and music. First discovering (classic) heavy metal music through my brother, and then fantasy books, and fantasy video games, made me feel like it was something of my own to be interested in. Being 10, and living in the outskirts of Warsaw, meant that life was simple and there wasn’t much to rebel against, there wasn’t much of a bad crowd to get mixed up with. </p>

  <p>The cursed words—graphic design—would take years to appear before me, but back then I was already attracted to its story-telling qualities, as well as a way for expressing yourself. Wearing a black t-shirt of Black Sabbath's <em>MASTER OF REALITY</em> cover art, which was nothing but huge purple letters, or of SABBATH BLODDY SABBATH, with its hellish and sexually suggestive cover, not to mention the huge scull with ‘666’ above it, was about the most rebellious thing I could do. Or so it seems in retrospect, back then it just mattered was that the music and the expressive letterings were as cool as they could be, and that was a base for finding my own self. </p>

  <p>Letters, letters, letters. With so little, with such minimal gestures, they can tell so much. Letters are similar to the ancient tales of myths. We know, more or less, their forms, and can anticipate how they start, and how they finish, what is their moral. Each (latin-based) culture has their own version, while having a shared backbone. They seem to have origins too far away for us to grasp. </p>

  <p>While letters seem to have been created already a some time ago (especially in the case of Roman capitals of the Trajan Column),
  they are in a state of constant transformation. Currently, it might be perhaps the most intense in recent history, during the last 30 years, thanks to the availability of the personal computer. While there might exist a hazy “standard” form of the letter that we are striving to achieve, like spoken tales, each one of us can insert their own interpretations, both from the side of the reader and the writer (of the letter). Generally, the overarching trends and models of typefaces have changed, like languages, organically over long periods of time. But unlike language, the letters which are carriers of language, were conjured by a few people at most, if not a single person. </p>

  <p>A type designer that's well aware of these poetical qualities of letters, is Jules Durand (a.k.a LazyDog)<sup><a href="#fn29-9219" id="fnr29-9219" title="see footnote" class="footnote">29</a></sup>. In his masters video/type designer manifesto called &quot;a Tale of Type&quot;, he presents his &quot;family tree&quot; of meticulously drawn typefaces. Jules moves freely across historical models of letters, Arts &amp; Crafts revivals, and modern video games references. He calls his typefaces &quot;Typographic Revivance&quot; as opposed to Typographic Revivals: having a clear starting point in a historical typeface, but transforming them further to his own vision. </p>

  <p>Technically, his typefaces are not different from, let's say, a contemporary neo-grotesque (Helvetica-like). They are drawn using the same computer software, approximated with the same logic of Bezier curves, and they are stored under the same .ttf/.otf file formats. However, they do <em>feel</em> different. </p>

  <p>On the form level, Durand employs a much bigger level of intricacy in the shapes. As he himself puts it, the qualities he looks for in typefaces are: &quot;ornamentation, exuberance &amp; refinement&quot;. On the level of presentation, by talking about typographical alchemy, showing interfaces of fantasy video games and magical 3D renders, he creates a deeper context for his letters. By tapping into the collective imagination on these morphologies, he creates an atmosphere of deeper history. Despite showing all his cards, the power of suggestion of the letter shapes and the visuals the combines them with upkeeps the suspension of disbelief. </p>

  <p>Roland Barthes in his collection of essays <em>Mythologies</em> describes the way that fringes of Ancient Rome are used as <em>signs</em> in Joseph Mankiewicz's movie <em>Julius Caesar</em>. Through all film, actors bear a &quot;little flag displayed on their foreheads&quot;, keeping up at all times the historical plausibility. </p>

  <p>In media dealing with the medieval and the medieval fantasy, we can observe a lot of such similar signs: horses, knight equipment, castles, etc. If enough of them are present, the suspension of disbelief is kept up, the magic happens. </p>

  <p>Few were more aware of these signifiers than the British comedy group Monty Python. In their film <em>Monty Python and the Holy Grail</em> they break the 4th wall in almost every scene, constantly exposing and mocking the art of cinema. In many cases, they have turned their film budget limitations into jokes – the most famous one being the usage of coconuts, in lieu of horse riding. Their play with theatrics of cinema, and the humorous awareness of the medium is incredible. As usual with Python productions, most of the characters that have dialogue are portrayed by one of the five members of the six-person group (sans Terry Gilliam). It's not uncommon for the same actor to play two different roles during a scene. Right from the start, they subvert the accuracy of the historical setting – the coconuts become a starting point of a discussion about air-speed velocity of African swallows. Later on, King Arthur comes across a pair of subjects, which look the part of medieval, plague disfigured peasant, but they question his kingly authority as a dictatorship, &quot;a self-perpetuating autocracy&quot; and claim to be living in a anarcho-syndicalist commune. About one-third into the movie, a &quot;famous historian&quot; shooting a documentary, but at the same time narrating the plot so far, is killed by one of the knights, leading to the anti-climax ending, where King Arthur is arrested by the British Police. </p>

  <p>How is the illusion kept? How despite all of this, despite the actors literally prancing about with their hands up in the air holding invisible reins, was I still 100% sure that I was watching a part of an Arthurian legend? The power of suggestion is so strong, that after each joke that breaks the illusion, within 10 seconds back in the action, the adventure continued.</p>

  <p>After the opening credits roll by, the film starts. The triumphant trumpets and harps reminiscent of court musicians announce the coming adventure. The Lombardic-like letters set the time and place: England, 932 A.D. Then, fog, a skeleton tied to a wooden pole, and a sound of horse's hooves (or so we think). Before subverting the cliches, they create such a fool-proof setting, they can always fall back into it, no matter how far they stray from it.</p>

  <p>Relying on such cliches and assumptions can also lead to very questionable results. In the 1981 animated movie <em>Heavy Metal</em>, based on stories from a legendary magazine of the same title, the characters are so unbelievably cliched, it becomes hilarious to watch today. The trope of the damsel in distress is very bluntly expressed visually – all of the female characters through out the movie, of course helpless and passive, have large breasts and are constantly sexually aroused. During the last, iconic segment, a female warrior Taarna takes the spotlight. We can immediately tell that she has a hero status, not only because of her wielding a sword and riding a giant bird, but also because of her considerably smaller cleavage.</p>
