  <h2>Abstract</h2>
  <!-- <br /> -->
  <p>In this text I am investigating the presence of visual themes in contemporary culture that relate to the medieval period in history. </p>

  <p>I try to examine some of the source material from the period, and its connection to what we consider the fantasy genre. I also attempt to find out why is there such a high degree of Euro-centric visuals in modern fantasy, as well as what kind of emotions they aim to evoke.</p>

  <h2>A foreword: The Afterimage</h2>

  <p>Take a good look at an image, best if it’s a very specific shape, on a contrasting background. If you stare at the centre of it for about 30 seconds, trying to relax your eyes and look “beyond” it, and then look at a blank wall, you’re still going to see it floating in front of your eyes, burned into your retina. While you can still make out the general shape of it, the form is already getting blurry. The colours are inverted into a weird cyan-green that doesn’t seem to exist in nature. After a few seconds the image now completely dissipates.</p>

  <p>I am interested in where and in what way can we see such “afterimages” of the European Middle Ages in today’s culture, mainly focusing on the fantasy genre and the iconography of archetypes such as knights, kings, castles and damsels in distress. We can find these archetypes in some of the most popular contemporary books, movies and TV shows. Despite things changing around us in a pace impossible to understand, and technology ruling our world more and more, we are still attracted to magic and swords. </p>

  <p>The fantasy genre is also directly connected to the rise of narrative driven video games, as both crept into the mainstream from the basements of nerd culture of the 1980s and 90s. Today, fantasy video games promise free-roaming adventures in lush, virtual worlds. Next to science fiction and superheroes stories, fantasy can be considered one of the pillars of mass-consumed fictional media.</p>

  <p>Is this phenomenon a reaction to a world where everything is known through science, and there’s little use for magic? Or, is it an attraction towards storytelling structures, that have so clearly defined conflicts and resolutions, as opposed to our complex lives? And, why does fantasy rely so much on euro-centric symbols ? </p>

  <p>After 500 years have passed, what are the afterimages of Medieval times that still linger in the collective retina? </p>
