  I think hard times are coming when we will be wanting the voices of writers who can see alternatives to how we live now and can see through our fear-stricken society and its obsessive technologies. We will need writers who can remember freedom. Poets, visionaries—the realists of a larger reality.  <br />— Ursula K. Le Guin <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">[1]</a></sup>

  <div><h2>A foreword: The Afterimage</h2></div>

  <p>Take a good look at an image, best if it’s a very specific shape, on a contrasting background. If you stare at the centre of it for about 30 seconds, trying to relax your eyes and look “beyond” it, and then look at a blank wall, you’re still going to see it floating in front of your eyes, burned into your retina. While you can still make out the general shape of it, the form is already getting blurry. The colours are inverted into a weird cyan-green, that doesn’t seem to exist in nature. After a few seconds the image now completely dissipates.</p>

  <p>I am interested in where, and in what way can we see such visual themes, mainly focusing on the literary genre of fantasy, and its connection to the European Middle Ages. We can find these afterimages in some of the most popular contemporary books, movies and TV shows. Despite things changing around us in a pace that makes the world impossible to understand, and technology ruling our world more and more, we are still attracted to magic and swords. </p>

  <p>Is this phenomenon a reaction to a world where everything is known through science, and there’s little use for magic? Or, is it an attraction towards storytelling structures, that have so clearly defined conflicts and resolutions, as opposed to our complex lives? And, why does fantasy rely so much on Euro-centric symbols? </p>

  <p>The fantasy genre is also directly connected to the rise of narrative driven video games, as both crept into the mainstream from the basements of nerd culture of the 1980s and 90s. Today, fantasy video games promise free-roaming adventures in lush, virtual worlds. Next to science fiction and superhero stories, fantasy can be considered one of the pillars of mass-consumed fictional media.</p>

  <p>After 500 years have passed, what are the afterimages of Medieval times that still linger in the collective retina? And, how do they influence the graphical language of today?</p>
