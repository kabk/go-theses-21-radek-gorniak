    “For fantasy is true, of course.

  </blockquote><h2>Fantasy Tales</h2>

  <p>So far, I have talked about European history and its interpretations, and about my experiences of living in Europe. However, looking at global pop culture today, you continue to see the Medieval afterimages. Asking friends that grew up in Brazil, USA or South Korea, confirms this—there seems to be some kind of shared imagination of fantasy tales, and visually it often harks back to some parts of the European iconography.</p>

  <p>But, the Medieval influence has been reduced to icons and associations, their meaning transformed, according to the times they were being used. </p>

  <p>As with Middle Ages, it’s hard to define specific dates when fantasy as a literary genre emerged, especially considering the long and ancient history of tales, filled with supernatural themes, and the vague distinction between what we could consider as &quot;religion&quot; and &quot;fiction&quot;.</p>

  <p>However, in relation to the Medieval, it could be said that the Romantic period of the XIX century introduced what we would consider &quot;pre-fantasy&quot;.<sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote">[22]</a></sup> It was a certain kind of nostalgia towards the supernatural, as a counteraction to the rational thinking of the Enlightenment, but carrying with Enlightenment’s perception of the Middle Ages as a period when imagination and the irrational ruled. </p>

  <p>For some, the goal was to preserve tales which lived only through oral tradition–the German Brothers Grimm wrote down and reintroduced a lot of common folk stories, some of which have clear references to medievality, such as Snow White, the Sleeping Beauty, or Rapunzel.</p>

  <p>In other cases, the Medieval afterimages were a a counter-reaction to the industrial revolution. An important example was the British author, socialist, artist and independent printer William Morris, that contributed to the Arts &amp; Crafts movement of the end of the XIX century. Morris had a deep admiration for the Middle Ages, which was reflected in the archaic language he used, to reference the old tales of romance. The period was also an inspiration for him in book production, as he was dissatisfied with the low-quality of mass-produced books of his time. The editions printed by him were richly decorated, and he incorporated the manuscript-like golden ratio for the page layout. His novel, <em>The Well at the World's End</em>, is an important early example of a story that not only talks about fantastical themes, but actually describes a purely fictional world different from our own.<sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote">[23]</a></sup> </p>

  <p>Morris also based some of his literature more directly on historical sources. The one source that stands out are the legends surrounding the catastrophic annihilation of an early Germanic people, know as the Burgundians, in 436 A.D. by the Huns, which acted as mercenary agents of the Roman Emperor. <sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote">[24]</a></sup></p>

  <p>The heroic age for the Teutonic people were the chaotic fifth and sixth centuries, when the Roman Empire was slowly collapsing before the Northern barbarian tribes. The events rose to legends by oral tradition, and were written down first as the <em>Völsunga saga</em> in Nordic traditions, and then in High German as the <em>Nibelungenlied</em>. <sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote">[25]</a></sup></p>

  <p>Both accounts differ from each other, and reflect the differences of the cultures they’re coming form, as well as the time they were written—<em>the Völsunga saga</em> is much more raw and interlaced with Nordic Mythology, while the later German counterpart carries more of the courtly traditions of the late Middle Ages.</p>

  <p>Something that both have in common is the presence of a magic ring which, along with a mythical treasure of the Nibelung clan, travels through many hands of heroes thirsty with greed (you might already expect where I am going with this).</p>

  <p>Morris wrote of the Volsunga: “This is the great story of the North, which should be to all our race what the tale of Troy was to the Greeks.” His <em>The Story of Sigurd the Volsung and the Fall of the Niblungs</em> was his retelling of the tale.</p>

  <p>We both know that there is something I've been avoiding so far, an ugly afterimage burned into the ground, that I have been trying turn my eyes from. All the talk about Teutonic mythologies, feelings of historical affirmation, national identities could be used for heinous purposes.</p>

  <p>In 1876, the same year that Morris’ interpretation of the Nordic legend was published, Richard Wagner premiered a cycle of four operas, called the <em>The Ring of the Nibelung</em>. It is often cited as the first expression of the identity of the then recently unified German nation.<sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote">[26]</a></sup> Wagner was very conscious of the links between politics and aesthetics of art. Here, he purposely used the key of Medieval tales, to unlock the imagination of Germany, as a supposedly superior nation. </p>

  <p>It would be only in the mid-XX century, when the old ring legends would be reclaimed back, for less morally repellent uses.</p>



  <h2 id="ring" name="ring">The Lord of the Ring</h2>

  <p>After various of those &quot;pre-fantasy&quot; examples, fantasy is widely considered to have started with the emergence of pulp magazines in the 1920s, in the USA. Here, it was all about short, easy to digest stories, and flashy covers, which would sell well.</p>

  <p>After the II World War, longer literary forms of fantasy became the main form, with <em>Lord of The Rings</em> proving the most popular. While the history of the fantasy genre consists of a number of different actors, and there isn’t a single point of creation, the legacy of J. R. R. Tolkien’s work cannot be overlooked. What set him apart from other (medieval) fantasy writers of his time, was the extent of the world building that he accomplished. Tolkien himself drew inspiration from all aspects of his life: from personal experiences, to his great knowledge about the European mythos. </p>

  <p>Tolkien's work is a great example of a Medieval afterimage used in fiction, an example towards which I have been building up my case. The way that shapes and patterns visually &quot;spilled&quot; across different mediums in historical art, which we perceive as harmony, here can be seen, done in a linguistic way. Tolkien used his knowledge of European history and literature, in order to deconstruct elements that could emotionally resonate with his readers. It's not that he created simple backstories for his novels—he constructed a whole world with a complete mythology, history that spans millennia, different alphabets and languages, detailed geography maps. Only on top of that, he figured out what kind of story to tell, and wrote his epic. </p>

  </figure>

  <p>What purpose does it all serve, for us, readers? Because of the language that Tolkien uses, and because of his fiction having roots in history, <em>Lord of the Rings</em> reads like something much older than it is. It is quite absurd—I know, in the back of my head, that I am reading fiction, written by an middle-aged English professor. But, when reading the book I feel like I was reading something much, much older. And thanks to Tolkien's attention to world building, we get a sense of something greater—in the end, the story presented in the book is only a small, last part in Middle Earth's history. </p>

  <p>Still, the Eurocentrism of author, and the time he was writing in, is still visible in key elements of the story–most of the main protagonists are male and suggested to be white, and the racial structures of Middle Earth could be considered strange and xenophobic.</p>

  <p>However, Tolkien introduces some themes which subvert the typically conservative ones. He was strongly opposed to both anti-semitism and apartheid, and in <em>Lord of the Rings</em> he presented the pitfalls of intolerance for being different, which lead to war and devastation. Furthermore in the story, which was written mostly during World War II, he presents a world dominated by violence, where arrogant masculinity has failed. His interest in Medieval heroines is reflected in a few female characters that do appear (Galadriel, Éowyn), similarly to the historical ones, as powerful and key actors in the story. </p>

  <p>Tolkien also transformed the historical sources themselves. Similarly to William Morris and Wagner before him, he was as well inspired by the <em>Völsunga saga</em>, and the <em>Nibelungenlied</em>. Morris specifically was a literary inspiration for Tolkien, both in his retelling of the <em>Völsunga</em>, and his fictional world of the <em>The Well at the World's End</em>. <sup id="fnref:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote">[27]</a></sup></p>

  <p>Wagner's opera <em>The Ring of the Nibelung</em> must have definitely influenced Tolkien's placement of the magic Ring as central in the plot. However, Tolkien sought to undo the damage done by Wagner’s repugnant ideology, and his usurpation of the <em>Völsunga</em> tales. This can be seen in how the power of the Ring is presented. Wagner's tale idealised the pursuit of power for its own sake. Tolkien on the other hand, updated the ring quest into the twentieth century, by turning it on its head—instead of the Ring being the ultimate prize of a mighty hero, the destruction of its corruptive power becomes the goal. This transformation can be further seen in the &quot;anti-hero&quot; of the Ring quest, Frodo. While noblemen and kings became corrupted by the Ring's power, the weak and merciful Frodo carries it to its doom.<sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote">[28]</a></sup></p>

  <p>Tolkien's influence can be seen far and wide in fantasy. He even influenced the use of English itself, as nowadays we almost exclusively use the form <em>dwarves</em>, as the plural for <em>dwarf</em>. Before the publication of <em>The Hobbit</em>, the common used form was <em>dwarfs</em>. Going beyond linguistics, I would consider most of fantasy that came later to be somewhat derivate of Tolkien's work. Apart from a few authors (Ursula K. Le Guin comes to mind), fantasy creators had to always somehow position themselves in regards to his work. </p>

  <p>Apart from literature, Tolkien also had a big influence on emerging new mediums, where readers would have a much more active role in both world building and storytelling. </p>

  <p>Tolkien's unlikely heroes and anti-war themes, which were also read as anti-nuclear, gained him a following among students in the 1960s, mainly in American campuses. While other fantasy authors followed in his footsteps, a separate interest grew in collective storytelling.</p>

  <p>Heavily inspired by Tolkien’s world, <em>Dungeons and Dragons</em>, first board game, and then tabletop roleplaying game, has been released in 1974. The books outlined a fictional fantasy world, its lore and creatures, spells and character classes. The games had a fantasy setting imposed onto them, but they encouraged storytelling for players, and creating their own personal characters. </p>

  <p>“Herds of nerds” loved the game, but with its popularity concerns of parents rose. It was called “the most effective introduction to the occult in the history of man”. The fact that teenagers were fantasising about magic and swords sparked controversy in the USA, especially among Christian groups, such as B.A.D.D. (Bothered About Dungeons and Dragons). <sup id="fnref:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote">[29]</a></sup></p>

  <p>Recognising that my personal experience with &quot;paper&quot; roleplaying games has been sporadic at best, I thought that it would be best to have a talk with someone with better experience on the topic. I've thought about my friend Héloïse d'Almeida, a French graphic designer, who I remembered being so dedicated to <em>Dungeons and Dragons</em>, that she was playing it with her friends through Skype (before it was the common way). While in Burgundy for the lockdown, she was kind enough to answer a few questions.</p>

  <p>As Heloise puts it, the world setting of Dungeons and Dragons is &quot;European Middle Ages, as seen as Americans, that weren't there&quot;, where a millennia worth's of history has been playfully mixed into a single entity, with Dragons thrown on top. Seems about right. </p>

  <figure>

  </figure>

  <p>The interesting thing is that she has no teenage nostalgia towards RPGs—when I first met her a year and a half ago, she has been playing for only two months. She first got into it by accident, by looking for videos on YouTube that she could listen to while working, and the 4 hour-long podcasts of D&amp;D play sessions were perfect, as they didn't require constant concentration. After that initial interest, Heloise and her sisters found a group of players in their neighbourhood in Paris, that were meeting every week for sessions.</p>

  <p>A big difference, in comparison to European history, that Héloïse points out is the way language is used: as all items, spells, weapons, etc. have to be clearly understandable in the game, Latin is substituted for very simple and descriptive names. For example, a potion that increases the strength of your character would be called &quot;Potion Of Giant Strength&quot;, as Giants are obviously very strong.</p>

  <p>Something that helps in keeping the link to Medieval history, is the game's strong reliance on the book medium. Here, the book serves two purposes: as the rules grew more and more complex over time, it was the only possible way to collect all this information, pre-Internet era. But, with their suggestive illustrations and skeuomorphic graphics, the game manuals also sparked imagination, and made the player feel like they were shuffling through the manuscripts of old. While most of the game resources are now available online, which is great for accessibility, Heloise admits that it doesn't carry the same emotional load, and she still shares a set of books between her friends. Which she does as the books are expensive to buy, but it also reinforces the link between the playing group. And, its a refreshing thing to care for something so deeply with your friends, as a counter to the throw-away culture.</p>

  <p>One set of books makes sense within roles that the players assume: one takes on the role of the Game (or Dungeon) Master, and others the roles of Player Characters. The Player Character is a single entity, that the player tries to role-play as, trying to imagine its personality, goals and decisions. As the games are mostly spoken, except for dice rolls and maps, the Dungeon Master takes care of the rest of the story: the narration, the world setting, the non-playable characters. </p>

  <p>For Héloïse, all of the complex and detailed combat rules, which can even detail up to a single inch what your character is doing, should only serve as a backdrop for the Game Master to create funny and interesting situations, an hour-long elaborate joke for the players to share, shared memories of things that didn't really happen. </p>

  <p>In the aspect of character role-play, Héloïse found that she prefers to play as characters which share some personality traits with her own – for example having a chaotic moral alignment, which often allows her to look for ways to bend the rules, which she says is similar to how she acts herself. On the other hand, playing as a lawful character proves to be too slow and confusing. (The rules of Dungeon and Dragons give the player a now well-known chart of 9 moral alignments to choose from, with Good, Neutral, Evil on one axis, and Lawful, Neutral and Chaotic on the other. Two neutrals result in the True Neutral alignment). </p>

  </figure>

  <p>Being on the other side of the Game Master screen, not only requires a great deal of preparation in the story and attention in keeping track of players actions, but can also be very unpredictable. Heloise clued me in how a Game Master can subtly direct the players by giving an illusion of choice, or leaving multiple clues towards one direction. On the other hand, the unpredictability is what sets the game apart – she mentioned a great moment, when, after being used more linear storylines, one realises what they can do with their characters is theoretically endless. </p>

<h2  id="letters" name="letters" >Letters and Signifiers</h2>

  <p>After being in kindergarten, when Pokémon ruled, I didn’t have many common interest with other kids when growing up. Not having much athletic talent, I also wasn’t very interested in football. That, combined with growing up in a non-Christian household meant missing out from the most common topics that kids were talking about, football and first communion. I found refuge in books and music. First discovering (classic) heavy metal music through my brother, and then fantasy books, and fantasy video games, made me feel like it was something of my own to be interested in. Being 10, and living in the outskirts of Warsaw, meant that life was simple and there wasn’t much to rebel against, there wasn’t much of a bad crowd to get mixed up with. </p>

  <p>The cursed words—graphic design—would take years to appear before me, but back then I was already attracted to its story-telling qualities, as well as a way for expressing yourself. Wearing a black t-shirt of Black Sabbath's <em>MASTER OF REALITY</em> cover art, which was nothing but huge purple letters, or of <em>SABBATH BLODDY SABBATH</em>, with its hellish and sexually suggestive cover, not to mention the huge scull with &quot;666&quot; above it, was about the most rebellious thing I could do. Or so it seems in retrospect, back then what mattered most was that the music and the expressive letterings were as cool as they could be, and that was a base for finding my own self. </p>

  <p>Letters, letters, letters. With so little, with such minimal gestures, they can tell so much. Letters are similar to the ancient tales of myths. We know, more or less, their forms, and can anticipate how they start, and how they finish, what is their moral. Each culture (that uses Latin alphabet) has their own version, while having a shared backbone. They also seem to have origins too far away for us to grasp. </p>

  </figure>

  <p>While letters seem to have been created already a some time ago (especially in the case of Roman capitals of the Trajan Column),
  they are in a state of constant transformation. Currently, it might be perhaps the most intense in recent history, during the last 30 years, thanks to the availability of the personal computer. While there might exist a hazy “standard” form of the letter that we are striving to achieve, like spoken tales, each one of us can insert their own interpretations, both from the side of the reader and the writer (of the letter). Generally, the overarching trends and models of typefaces have changed, like languages, organically over long periods of time. But unlike language, the letters, which are carriers of language, were conjured by a few people at most, if not a single person. </p>

  <p>A type designer that's well aware of these poetical qualities of letters, is Jules Durand (a.k.a LazyDog).<sup id="fnref:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote">[30]</a></sup> In his masters video/type designer manifesto called <em>a Tale of Type</em>, he presents his &quot;family tree&quot; of meticulously drawn typefaces. Jules moves freely across historical models of letters, Arts &amp; Crafts revivals, and modern video games references. He calls his typefaces &quot;Typographic Revivance&quot; as opposed to Typographic Revivals: having a clear starting point in a historical typeface, but transforming them further to his own vision. </p>

  <p>Technically, his typefaces are not different from, let's say, a contemporary neo-grotesque (Helvetica-like). They are drawn using the same computer software, approximated with the same logic of Bezier curves, and they are stored under the same .ttf/.otf file formats. However, they do <em>feel</em> different. </p>

  <figure>

  <figcaption><em>A Tale of Type</em> (2020)</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>On the form level, Durand employs a much bigger level of intricacy in the shapes. As he himself puts it, the qualities he looks for in typefaces are: &quot;ornamentation, exuberance &amp; refinement&quot;.<sup id="fnref:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote">[31]</a></sup> On the level of presentation, by talking about typographical alchemy, showing interfaces of fantasy video games and magical 3D renders, he creates a deeper context for his letters. By tapping into the collective imagination on these morphologies, he creates an atmosphere of deeper history. Despite showing all his cards, the power of suggestion of the letter shapes and the visuals the combines them with upkeeps the suspension of disbelief. </p>

  <p>Roland Barthes in his collection of essays <em>Mythologies</em> describes the way that fringes of Ancient Rome are used as <em>signs</em> in Joseph Mankiewicz's movie <em>Julius Caesar</em>. Throughout the film, actors bear a &quot;little flag displayed on their foreheads&quot;, keeping up at all times the historical plausibility. </p>

  <p>In media dealing with the medieval and the medieval fantasy, we can observe a lot of such similar signs: horses, knights equipment, castles, etc. If enough of them are present, the suspension of disbelief is kept up, the magic happens. </p>

  <p>Few were more aware of these signifiers than the British comedy group Monty Python. In their film <em>Monty Python and the Holy Grail</em> they break the 4th wall in almost every scene, constantly exposing and mocking the art of cinema. In many cases, they have turned their film budget limitations into jokes – the most famous one being the usage of coconuts, in lieu of horse riding. Their play with theatrics of cinema, and the humorous awareness of the medium is incredible. As usual with Python productions, most of the characters that have dialogue are portrayed by one of the five members of the six-person group (sans Terry Gilliam). It's not uncommon for the same actor to play two different roles during a scene. Right from the start, they subvert the accuracy of the historical setting – the coconuts become a starting point of a discussion about air-speed velocity of African swallows. Later on, King Arthur comes across a pair of subjects, which look the part of medieval, plague disfigured peasant, but they question his kingly authority as a dictatorship, &quot;a self-perpetuating autocracy&quot; and claim to be living in a anarcho-syndicalist commune. About one-third into the movie, a &quot;famous historian&quot; shooting a documentary, but at the same time narrating the plot so far, is killed by one of the knights. This in turn leads to the anti-climax ending, where King Arthur is arrested by the British Police. </p>

  <p>How is the illusion kept? How despite all of this, despite the actors literally prancing about with their hands up in the air holding invisible reins, was I still 100% sure that I was watching a part of an Arthurian legend? The power of suggestion is so strong, that after each joke that breaks the illusion, within 10 seconds back in the action, the tale continued.</p>

  <p>After the opening credits roll by, the film starts. The triumphant trumpets and harps reminiscent of court musicians announce the coming adventure. The Lombardic-like letters set the time and place: England, 932 A.D. Then, fog, a skeleton tied to a wooden pole, and a sound of horse's hooves (or so we think). Before subverting the cliches, they create such a fool-proof setting, they can always fall back into it, no matter how far they stray from it.</p>

  <p>Relying on such cliches and assumptions can also lead to very questionable results. In the 1981 animated movie <em>Heavy Metal</em>, based on stories from a legendary magazine of the same title, the characters are so unbelievably cliched, it becomes both hilarious and uncomfortable to watch today. The trope of the damsel in distress is very bluntly expressed visually – all of the female characters through out the movie, of course helpless and passive, have large breasts and are constantly sexually aroused. During the last, iconic segment, a female warrior Taarna takes the spotlight. We can immediately tell that she has a hero status, not only because of her wielding a sword and riding a giant bird, but also because of her considerably smaller cleavage.</p>
