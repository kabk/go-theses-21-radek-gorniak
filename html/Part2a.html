  <h2>Fantasy Tales</h2>

  <p>So far, I have talked about European history and its interpretations, and about my experiences of living in Europe. However, looking at global pop culture today, you continue to see the Medieval afterimages. Asking friends that grew up in Brazil, USA or South Korea, confirms this—there seems to be some kind of shared imagination of fantasy tales, and visually it often harks back to some parts of the European iconography.</p>

  <p>But, the Medieval influence has been reduced to icons and associations, their meaning transformed, according to the times they were being used. </p>

  <p>As with Middle Ages, it’s hard to define specific dates when fantasy as a literary genre emerged, especially considering the long and ancient history of tales, filled with supernatural themes, and the vague distinction between what we could consider as ‘religion’ and ‘fiction’.</p>

  <p>However, in relation to the Medieval, it could be said that the Romantic period of the XIX century introduced what we would consider &quot;pre-fantasy&quot;.<sup><a href="#fn21-9219" id="fnr21-9219" title="see footnote" class="footnote">21</a></sup> It was a certain kind of nostalgia towards the supernatural, as a counteraction to the rational thinking of the Enlightenment, but carrying with Enlightenment’s perception of the Middle Ages as a period when imagination and the irrational ruled. </p>

  <p>For some, the goal was to preserve tales which lived only through oral tradition–the German Brothers Grimm wrote down and reintroduced a lot of common folk stories, some of which have clear references to medievality, such as Snow White, the Sleeping Beauty, or Rapunzel.</p>

  <p>In other cases, the Medieval afterimages were a a counter-reaction to the industrial revolution. An important example was the British author, artist and independent printer William Morris, that contributed to the Arts &amp; Crafts movement of the end of the XIX century. Morris had a deep admiration for the Middle Ages, which was reflected in the archaic language he used, to reference the old tales of romance. The period was also an inspiration for him in book production, as he was dissatisfied with the low-quality of mass-produced books of his time. The editions printed by him were richly decorated, and he incorporated the manuscript-like golden ration for the page layout. His novel, <em>The Well at the World's End</em>, is an important early example of a story that not only talks about fantastical themes, but actually describes a purely fictional world different from our own. <sup><a href="#fn22-9219" id="fnr22-9219" title="see footnote" class="footnote">22</a></sup></p>

  <p>Morris also based some of his literature more directly on historical sources. The one that stands out are the legends surrounding the catastrophic annihilation of an early Germanic people, know as the Burgundians, in 436 A.D. by the Huns, acting as mercenary agents of the Roman Emperor. <sup><a href="#fn23-9219" id="fnr23-9219" title="see footnote" class="footnote">23</a></sup></p>

  <p>The heroic age for the Teutonic people were the chaotic fifth and sixth centuries, when the Roman Empire was slowly collapsing before the Northern barbarian tribes. The events rose to legends by oral tradition, and were written down first as the <em>Völsunga saga</em> in Nordic traditions, and then in High German as the <em>Nibelungenlied</em>. <sup><a href="#fn24-9219" id="fnr24-9219" title="see footnote" class="footnote">24</a></sup></p>

  <p>Both accounts differ from each other, and reflect the differences of the cultures they’re coming form, as well as the time they were written—<em>the Völsunga saga</em> is much more raw and interlaced with Nordic Mythology, while the later German counterpart carries more of the courtly traditions of the late Middle Ages.</p>

  <p>Something that both have in common is the presence of a magic ring which, along with a mythical treasure of the Nibelung clan, travels through many hands of heroes thirsty with greed (you might already expect where I am going with this).</p>

  <p>Morris wrote of the Volsunga: “This is the great story of the North, which should be to all our race what the tale of Troy was to the Greeks.” His <em>The Story of Sigurd the Volsung and the Fall of the Niblungs</em> was his retelling of the tale.</p>

  <p>We both know that there is something I've been avoiding so far, an ugly afterimage burned into the ground, that I have been trying turn my eyes from. All the talk about Teutonic mythologies, feelings of historical affirmation, national identities could be used for heinous purposes.</p>

  <p>In 1876, the same year that Morris’ interpretation of the Nordic legend was published, Richard Wagner premiered a cycle of four operas, called the <em>The Ring of the Nibelung</em>. It is often cited as the first expression of the identity of the then recently unified German nation.<sup><a href="#fn25-9219" id="fnr25-9219" title="see footnote" class="footnote">25</a></sup> Wagner was very conscious of the links between politics and aesthetics of art. Here, he purposely used the key of Medieval tales, to unlock the imagination of Germany, as a supposedly superior nation. </p>

  <p>It would be only in the mid-XX century, when the old ring legends would be reclaimed back for less morally repellent uses.</p>

  <h3>The Lord of the Ring</h3>

  <p>After various of those ‘pre-fantasy’ examples, fantasy is widely considered to have started with the emergence of pulp magazines in the 1920s, in the USA. Here, it was all about short, easy to digest stories, and flashy covers, which would sell well.</p>

  <p>After the II World War, longer literary forms emerged, with <em>Lord of The Rings</em> proving the most popular. While the history of the fantasy genre consists of a number of different actors, and there isn’t a single point of creation, the legacy of J. R. R. Tolkien’s work cannot be overlooked. What set him apart from other (medieval) fantasy writers of his time, was the extent of the world building that he accomplished. Tolkien himself drew inspiration from all aspects of his life: from personal experiences, to his great knowledge about the European mythos. </p>

  <p>Tolkien's example is a great one of a Medieval afterimage used in fiction, an example towards which I have been building up my case. The way that shapes and patterns visually &quot;spilled&quot; across different mediums in historical art, which we perceive as harmony, here can be seen, done in a linguistic way. Tolkien used his knowledge of history, and of literature, in order to deconstruct elements that could emotionally resonate with his readers. It's not that he created simple backstories for his novels—he constructed a whole world with a complete mythology, history that spans millennia, different alphabets and languages, detailed geography maps. Only on top of that, he figured out what kind of story to tell, and wrote his epic. </p>

  <p>What purpose does it all serve, for us, readers? Because of the language that Tolkien uses, and because of his fiction having roots in history, <em>Lord of the Rings</em> reads like something much older than it is. It is quite absurd—I know, in the back of my head, that I am reading fiction, written by an middle-aged English professor. But, </p>

  <p>Still, the Eurocentrism of author, and the time he was writing in is still visible in key elements of the story–most of the main protagonists are male and suggested to be white, and the racial structures of Middle Earth could be considered strange and xenophobic.</p>

  <p>However, Tolkien introduces some themes which subvert the typically conservative ones. He was strongly opposed to both anti-semitism and apartheid, and in <em>Lord of the Rings</em> he presented the pitfalls of intolerance for difference, which lead to war and devastation. Furthermore in the story, which was written mostly during World War II, he presents a world dominated by violence, where arrogant masculinity has failed. His interest in Medieval heroines is reflected in a few female characters that do appear (Galadriel, Éowyn), similarly to the historical ones, as powerful and key actors in the story. </p>

  <p>Tolkien also transformed the historical sources themselves. Similarly to William Morris and Wagner before him, he was as well inspired by the <em>Völsunga saga</em>, and the <em>Nibelungenlied</em>. Morris specifically was a literary inspiration for Tolkien, both in his retelling of the <em>Völsunga</em>, and his fictional world of the <em>The Well at the World's End</em>. <sup><a href="#fn26-9219" id="fnr26-9219" title="see footnote" class="footnote">26</a></sup></p>

  <p>Wagner's opera <em>The Ring of the Nibelung</em> must have definitely influenced Tolkien's placement of the magic Ring as central in the plot. However, Tolkien sought to undo the damage done by Wagner’s repugnant ideology, and his usurpation of the <em>Völsunga</em> tales. This can be seen in how the power of the Ring is presented. Wagner's tale idealised the pursuit of power for its own sake. Tolkien on the other hand, updated the ring quest into the twentieth century, by turning it on its head—instead of the Ring being the ultimate prize of a mighty hero, the destruction of its corruptive power becomes the goal. This transformation can be further seen in the &quot;anti-hero&quot; of the Ring quest, Frodo. While noblemen and kings became corrupted by the Ring's power, the weak and merciful Frodo carries it to its doom.<sup><a href="#fn27-9219" id="fnr27-9219" title="see footnote" class="footnote">27</a></sup></p>

  <p>Tolkien's influence can be seen far and wide in fantasy. He even influenced the use of English itself, as nowadays we almost exclusively use the form &quot;dwarves&quot;, as the plural for &quot;dwarf&quot;. Before the publication of <em>The Hobbit</em>, the common used form was &quot;dwarfs&quot;. Going beyond linguistics, I would consider most of fantasy that came later to be somewhat derivate of Tolkien's work. Apart from a few authors (Ursula K. Le Guin comes to mind), fantasy creators had to always somehow position themselves in regards to his work. </p>

  <p>Apart from literature, Tolkien also had a big influence on emerging new mediums, where readers would have a much more active role in both world building and storytelling. </p>
