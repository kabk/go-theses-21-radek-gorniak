  <h2>Theory of Seeing</h2>

  <p>To better understand what are the Medieval afterimages, I would like to start at the beginning, that is, in the middle, and briefly look at the visual source material from the time, with a little help from an expert. </p>

  <p>Personally, I have been drawn to the period because of the many contradictions that surround it. Having the “middle” infamy, despite, as I found out, being a quite clear beginning of the way modern European states are shaped, marking the appearance of the first universities, and establishing a strong tradition in the use of reason. However, it still retains a certain strangeness and &quot;darkness&quot;. I think that contradiction is best seen in visual art from the period.</p>

  <p>On one hand, we can observe gold decorated manuscripts, rich tapestries, monumental churches. On the other, I can’t help but laugh at the crude and symbolic compositions with an almost non existent perspective, especially baffling when keeping in mind the preceding hellenistic paintings and the succeeding renaissance ones. Looking at them today, it's difficult to determine what was done as a joke, or did people back then really believe that knights fought snails, and men, whose heads did grow beneath their shoulders, roamed the Earth. It has been a long-unanswered mystery for me. </p>

  <p>While I don't think there's a simple, hidden answer for that question, I have gained a better understanding for why was Medieval art the way it was. The biggest help in that process has been <em>Theory of Seeing</em>, a book by Władysław Strzemiński, which I found precious not only because of showing art history in an atypical manner, but also it being available only in Polish. Because of that, and because his line of reasoning is confusing at best, I will try to slowly explain the general idea. </p>

  <p>I love off-topic backstories to a fault, so here's one: Władysław Strzemiński (1893–1952) was a polymath in a true sense go the word—he had a technical engineering education, he was a successful avant-garde painter (he studied under Kazimir Malevich), and at the end of his life, he was a prominent professor at the art academy in Łódź. On top of that, he developed an interest in the physical aspects of eyesight, mainly because of World War I injuries he suffered. <em>Theory of Seeing</em> was supposed to combine all of those interests into one work, but in a typical fashion of a Polish tragedy, he passed away after World War II, ostracised by the communist establishment, before fully completing the book. <sup><a href="#fn8-9219" id="fnr8-9219" title="see footnote" class="footnote">8</a></sup></p>

  <p>At the beginning of the book, Strzemiński starts simple enough, by looking at art history not as an isolated process, but in close connection to societal structures, technological advancements and other historical turmoils. He states that since ancient civilisations have formed, our actual eyesight, in a biological sense, has not evolved.<sup><a href="#fn9-9219" id="fnr9-9219" title="see footnote" class="footnote">9</a></sup> Yet, we can observe a growing visual awareness in how eyesight was used, in arts, throughout history: starting with contour vision of the paleolit, through silhouette vision, to the perspective discoveries of the renaissance. He accentuates that our notions of realism in art have changed, and that the process of a growing visual awareness is a reflection of historical progress.<sup><a href="#fn10-9219" id="fnr10-9219" title="see footnote" class="footnote">10</a></sup></p>

  <p>In a way, it sounds very obvious. Yes, art did become more complex as civilisations became more developed. But, by framing art history not only as styles that just &quot;happened&quot; in a vacuum, Strzemiński creates interesting connections. </p>

  <p>For example, he explains why in so many cultures we can observe a transformation from free-form linear drawings<sup><a href="#fn11-9219" id="fnr11-9219" title="see footnote" class="footnote">11</a></sup> (think cave drawings) into monumental, rhythmical and ornamental art. The common element in these cultures, such as Egypt, Mesopotamia, Peru and India, was a close relationship to controlling water sources, as well as the supremacy of the priesthood caste. Their dependency on calendars to predict flooding and optimal harvest times, as well as keeping complex irrigation systems required strict and competent governance.<sup><a href="#fn12-9219" id="fnr12-9219" title="see footnote" class="footnote">12</a></sup></p>

  <p>Let's look at a visual example from Ancient Egypt: the Narmer Palette, dated to be around 5000 years old. Looking at one of its sides, we can clearly see the king, the representative of priesthood rule. Standing below the heads of gods, not only is his silhouette is the biggest one, but also the most unique one, with a crown on his head, and symbols of power in his hands. All other human beings, especially his decapitated victims, are repeated and devoid of personality, reflecting the structure of society in Egypt.</p>

  <p>The madman Strzemiński goes further. In order to explain some of the pattern-like, rhythmical qualities of ancient art, he introduces the concept of &quot;architectonisation&quot;: a process of connecting shapes of objects across mediums, and creating a rhythmical relationship between them. Sculpture and pottery. Architecture and painting.<sup><a href="#fn13-9219" id="fnr13-9219" title="see footnote" class="footnote">13</a></sup></p>

  <p>It gets even better: as before, Strzemiński doesn't look at this process as something disconnected from reality of being, and reality of seeing. For him, a reason for such fluid &quot;spilling&quot; of forms and shapes across objects, is the phenomenon of the afterimage. Having a pattern burned into your retina for a few seconds, and then seeing it again in a different object makes you feel harmony, makes you feel beauty.<sup><a href="#fn14-9219" id="fnr14-9219" title="see footnote" class="footnote">14</a></sup> </p>

  <p>So, how does it all connect to Medieval art? </p>

  <p>When describing the Middle Ages, at first Strzemiński points out the apparent: the seeming ‘fall’ of civilisation with the decline of the Hellenic Roman-Greek culture. Looking at it today, we might view the Late Hellenic art as 'realistic': it used three-dimensional perspective, and subtly complex colours, usually to show material qualities of commodities.<sup><a href="#fn15-9219" id="fnr15-9219" title="see footnote" class="footnote">15</a></sup></p>

  <p>When the Medieval age rolled in, the continuity of progression in art has been broken. In some areas, the Romanesque art of Northern and Central Europe regressed to primitive silhouette art, or even at times line art, which corresponds with the art of the early Ancient Egypt, with around 4000 years of difference in between.<sup><a href="#fn16-9219" id="fnr16-9219" title="see footnote" class="footnote">16</a></sup></p>

  <p>Staying on the level of a formal analysis (ie. one that analyses only the elements of the form), it can be said that both art of the Middle Ages and Ancient Egypt uses “intentional perspective”, where scale of an individual represents their importance in the social hierarchy (like in the earlier example of the Narmer Palette).<sup><a href="#fn17-9219" id="fnr17-9219" title="see footnote" class="footnote">17</a></sup> But to explain why the societies of Early Middle Ages also used that perspective, Strzemiński goes away from formal analysis and back to his definition of visual awareness: as a reflection of reality of a given point in time, that a given society reached at that point. </p>

  <p>So, similarities should be looked for also in structures of societies: after the fall of the Roman Empire, Medieval Europe was ruled by the priesthood class, similar to early Antiquity.</p>

  <p>Architectonisation, the transfer of shapes through afterimage, also makes a comeback. In both Romanesque and Byzantine art the square serves as the often repeated element, the base for architectural constructions and painting compositions.<sup><a href="#fn18-9219" id="fnr18-9219" title="see footnote" class="footnote">18</a></sup></p>

  <p>But, to make a bold statement, Middle Ages were not the Antiquity, despite the initial similarities. Before, it took thousands of years to come from silhouette drawings to the Hellenic perspective. This time, it took a few hundred years at most. Instead of thinking of the Medieval period as a &quot;dead&quot; one, Strzemiński argues that it was one of the most accelerated periods of reconstructing society on top of a new, feudal structure. <sup><a href="#fn19-9219" id="fnr19-9219" title="see footnote" class="footnote">19</a></sup></p>
