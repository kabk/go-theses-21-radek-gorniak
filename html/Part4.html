    <p>Initially when I was going into this topic, I was simply following my instinct for interesting images, and I was mainly aiming to treat this text as a chronicle for the time I was writing it in, and the research I have done. </p>

    <p>However, I was happy to discover that by spending some time learning about Middle Ages, I was be able to gain a better understanding of the period, and how it has far-reaching effects on so many areas of, well, everything. It felt refreshing
      to be able to break through the surface of shallow Internet research, going into archives, touching history, looking for it everywhere, around the streets, under my bed. By doing that, and most importantly, discussing fantasy with others, the
      story started to emerge. I saw that when seen in the &quot;real&quot; world, the Medieval afterimages serve as a reminder of history. A reminder that is often used to legitimise the one who is reminding, be it the legislative power of a city
      hall, or the production qualities of a beer company.</p>

    <p>But, in the case of fiction, the function of those afterimages is different. In hundred-year-old fantasy literature, or in Minecraft—here the afterimages are used as an anchor of sorts. An anchor that through shared imagination of history,
      gives us a base of understanding, from which the author can deviate from. Furthermore, the historical origin of those afterimages acts as a key that evokes dreaming on the reader. But, dreaming in a different sense than dreaming of desires for
      a better future, be it a better future for you, or the world. Instead, it unlocks dreaming through the past, that breaks that anticipation of what's to come. It helps to dream of a time and space separate from ours.</p>



    <p>My final conclusions are not groundbreaking. But, by going through that path, I am able to stand behind them more firmly, and be more aware of afterimages of the Medieval, and also other, periods. For better or worse, there is no escaping
      history. So it seems to me, to be able to understand where we are today, visually, to see the snowball getting bigger and bigger, the best way to start would be to understand the past.</p>

    <p>I can only hope that you, on the other side of the screen, has left this text somewhat more informed, or at least entertained. </p>
