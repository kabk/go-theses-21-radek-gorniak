  <h2>Algorithmic Storytelling</h2>

  <p>In case of modern example of the afterimage, we can observe a multi-layer cake of nostalgia, starting from history, through fantasy literature and early role-playing games. </p>

  <p>Because D&amp;D and subsequent fantasy games started gaining popularity in the USA and then rest of the world in the 1980s, they were a perfect inspiration for the developing market of video games, mainly home console and computer games. Whereas ‘classical’ paper and pen roleplaying games required free-form, abstract thinking from its players, the computer ones focused more on structure and logic.</p>

  <p>Today, those early computer games are referenced in another layer of nostalgia, in based on algorithmic structures and machine-learning.</p>

  <p><em>Dwarf Fortress</em>, one of such examples, is a dungeon-manager simulator at its core.<sup><a href="#fn30-9219" id="fnr30-9219" title="see footnote" class="footnote">30</a></sup> By default, the game is made purely of ASCII characters, so until a player uploads a graphical texture package, most that you see are letters and symbols of different colours (a perfect game for a typographer?). So, visually, not only is your imagination directed to something older because of the medieval setting, but also because of the 1980s aesthetics. A double afterimage. </p>

  <p>The familiarity also helps to create a sense of immersion much quicker, despite the archaic interface. This is brought further before the game proper starts. Before you gather your team of trusty dwarves, you go through the process of world building. Simulation runs, every time randomly generating geography, history, etc. through the passage of time. From the created world, you only occupy a small chunk of it. What took Tolkien his whole creative life, here can be generated in just a few seconds. </p>

  <p>Another example that I found is the web browser game <em>AI Dungeon</em>.<sup><a href="#fn31-9219" id="fnr31-9219" title="see footnote" class="footnote">31</a></sup> Here, the user interface is very minimal, in principle it is a text based game, reminiscent of the old text adventure games, created at American universities in the 1970s, often as a showcase of the possible computing power of new machines.</p>

  <p>As you might have deducted from the name, there is a crucial difference in how the text read by the player is generated. In the older games, the programmers had to write all the possible situations that the player might encounter. Also, a very specific list of actions that the player can choose from was crucial – there could be no misunderstandings, for the story to go forward.</p>

  <p>In the case of the <em>AI Dungeon</em>, there is no preset stories, and no pre-determined actions that you have to choose from. You do have to choose from a few possible world settings (such as Fantasy, Cyberpunk, Apocalyptic, etc.) and then a character within that setting. In the case of Fantasy—you can choose from the usual suspects: a Knight, a Wizard, a Princess, etc. Then, the AI is your Game Master, introducing you to the story and the world in a few sentences. Then, you can freely type what your character might do, say, or you might even fill some of the story by yourself.</p>

  <p>As impressive as it is coding-wise, in the end you could say that the &quot;game&quot; is simply a glorified, way more elaborate chatbot. But, as in many previous examples, the historical afterimages act as a key into your imagination, to help you submerge in the fantasy. </p>

  <p>The difference is that in both games, the element of a personal interaction is taken out, as you are not reading deep thoughts of a book author, or you are not collectively dreaming with other nerds sitting next to you. Or that's how it might seem, as in the end the algorithms in question didn't fall out the sky, they were also written by human beings. What's the difference then? It might be the removal of a tactile objects (no books, no dice, etc.), or it might be simply my bias because of knowing that I am looking at something automatically generated, and not considerably made.</p>
