  <h1>PART 0: The Embarkment</h1>

  <blockquote>
  <p>I think hard times are coming when we will be wanting the voices of writers who can see alternatives to how we live now and can see through our fear-stricken society and its obsessive technologies. We will need writers who can remember freedom. Poets, visionaries—the realists of a larger reality.</p>
  </blockquote>
