  <h2>Living History</h2>

  <h3>Afterimages in surroundings</h3>

  <p>As I found out during the research for this text, by starting to dig into history you can almost never stop with following a thread back and back through time. Still, it has become clear for me how the Middle Ages period seems to be the cradle of today’s Europe, the region that has been physically and culturally my home. Understanding that period better has helped to understand the state of affairs today. </p>

  <p>Its afterimage is still visible today. It was the period that established Christian dominance in the region. While in countries like the Netherlands or Germany its strong influence is well hidden under secular statehoods, in countries like Poland, where I'm from, it is much more direct.</p>

  <p>I remember very well from history lessons that the moment considered to be the beginning of the history of Poland was its baptism in 966 A.D. Almost over a 1000 years later, it was still seen as a moment defining the whole country’s identity. Throughout many dynasties, political systems and hostile invasions, Christianity is portrayed as the stable element throughout history. Despite being theoretically a secular state, you can observe the crucifix in most state organisations, courts and schools. </p>

  <p>Apart from Christian elements, I was able to observe many Medieval afterimages during my internship period in Berlin, for example conducting extensive research on the long tradition of local German beers. Here, blackletter typography and labels that refer to old guild emblems are supposed to give the product a sense of historical legitimacy. Similarly, across many European cities we can still observe coats of arms, flags, or different heraldic symbols with that refer to the Medieval past. For example, Berlin’s coat of arms is a black bear, a symbol that can be traced back almost 800 years back. </p>

  <p>Being in Berlin also helped me to use the cities resources available, and visit local archives and libraries.</p>

  <h3>Liber Chronicarum</h3>

  <p>On the 30th of October 2020, the last possible day before it was closed off to non-university users, I managed to reserve a time slot in the library of the Humboldt University in Berlin. It’s an impressive building, funnily enough called the Jacob-und-Wilhelm-Grimm-Zentrum. When I used to study Architecture, I remember staring for hours at the photographs of its grand reading room, accentuated by a square construction grid, with a void space that spans 5 floors. And I finally ended up here, in the strangest circumstances. After a bit of back and forth with the reception, regarding my lack of necessary library cards, I arrived at the 6th floor (above the void-reading room), in the Historical Collections room. Even before going in, I already had a feeling that I shouldn’t be there, that I was trespassing in some secret governmental archive. It was hard to believe that I was let inside, just thanks to a few e-mails, and no money taken from me. Being so used to having to pay for everything, even for some of the PDFs that I have read for writing this text, it feels very strange to be able to see such important cultural artefacts, entirely for free.</p>

  <p>I had requested to see a copy of the Nurnberg Chronicle, a “compendium of universal history”, a brainchild of Hartmann Schedel, a doctor in Nurnberg. It is one of the most densely illustrated and technically advanced works of early printing. It is also notable for having one of the first woodcuts made by Albrecht Dürer. The specific copy that I was able to see has been printed in 1493, merely 50 years after Johannes Gutenberg started using movable type for printing. After the necessary clearances and preparations, I was able to look through the book freely, spending as much time as I saw fit.</p>

  <p>Seeing the book in front of my eyes, made me notice completely different things than looking at scans on the screen, even the high quality ones. First of all, the size of it makes a big difference—each page is about A3, or even bigger in size. That made me less focused on the spread as a singe image, but instead I started reading it as a collection of elements, often quite well detailed. For example, looking at the scans on the screen I would never have noticed that while the text is set with movable type (you can see repeated letter forms), the lettering in the woodcuts is custom made, and a part of the illustration. </p>

  <p>Each woodcut became a collection of lines, which immediately de-mystified the book for me, instead of some strange, other worldly object, it became something that a human being could actually produce. </p>

  <p>Not that it made the thing less impressive, or diminished its importance for me. Touching the paper from 600 years ago, even if through the gloves (that is until the lady at the desk looked somewhere else), can be only a spiritual experience.</p>

  <p>Having the book in front of me, all to my disposal, in a highly guarded building, wearing white gloves made me think of a coroner about to conduct an autopsy. Or rather, of a scholar of the arcane, about to unravel some awesome secret. There were no websites to summarise and categorise the object, no descriptions to skew my interpretation, no experts to guide my attention. The only “facts” I could rely on was the knowledge I already had, and the empirical observations that I could conduct. </p>

  <p>The thing that has been de-mystified the most for me, was the books purpose, or rather the bulk of its contents. In the end, after an introduction that describes the creation of the world (which of course is based on the Bible, apparently the did not hear about the “rational” Renaissance being around the corner), most of the book is actually a description of cities in the Holy Roman Empire, and the noble families that had lived in them.</p>

  <p>At the end of the book, I stumbled upon Wrocław, the city in Poland that I was born in. Seeing it in such an old account made me full realise that history did, in fact, happen. By holding history in my hands, it stopped being a vague annoyance preached by teachers in schools, but an actual cycle of generations, existing for hundred thousand years before me. </p>

  <p>Coming from a country with an eroded sense of continuity, and having lived in many different places myself, it becomes even more important to find such a proof of historical legitimacy, as a counter to the liquid modernity of today.

  Feeling a rush of excitement, I wanted to see more artefacts, while still in Berlin. Using the Nurnberg Chronicle as a starting point, I have gone to the Kupferstichkabinett, the Museum of Prints and Drawings in Berlin, to see original prints of Albrecht Dürer.</p>

  <p>Again, seeing how important it is to see things in the flesh, or in the paper, felt like coming out of a long coma, and re-learning things that I knew well before. It is such a basic thing, it is easy for me to forget. It felt like a glass wall of the screen has been lifted in front of my eyes. A curtain lifted, transforming an image I was seeing as only that, an image, into a collection of exposed elements, ready for me to interpret. </p>

  <p>The way I look at things, and the way my focus works, makes me rarely look beyond what I am seeing. I rarely analyse and interpret things on my own. Usually the form of an image is what interests me, not its meaning. </p>

  <p>I think it’s interesting to look at Albrecht Dürer’s work, and other examples of the early printmaking, because of their existence on the border of the Medieval and the Renaissance periods. I could definitely see a difference in quality of his image-making, when comparing his earliest works I’ve seen (Nurnberg Chronicle) and latest (Melancholia). I would argue that his early works are an example of Medieval methodology, while using Renaissance technology. Apart from Melancholia, I've seen prints from Dürer's <em>Apocalypse</em> – a popular topic at the time, as people believed that we world would end in the year 1500. (The Nurnberg Chronicle itself has empty pages left at the end, for people to record the last years of the universe).</p>

  <p>In comparison to my previous viewing, the Dürer prints were presented to me as single sheets, in a cardboard passepartout. No one in the building really spoke English, but I was able to communicate with a mix of basic German and English, as I had to receive detailed instructions how to handle the artworks. After signing some paperwork regarding the rights to the pictures I have taken, I was left all by myself with the drawings. Just me and Dürer. With the prints sitting on a small wooden easel, it felt like I was visiting an old friend locked away in prison. </p>

  <p>The first one I viewed was <em>Saint Michael Fighting the Dragon</em>, from The Apocalypse. At the beginning, I was simply amazed by the quality of the artwork, and overwhelmed by the fact of seeing the print in front of me, in my hand’s reach. After viewing the rest, I returned to it, to analyse it better. Because of my perverse interests in letters, the first thing to have caught my attention was Dürer’s famous composite monogram, sitting at the bottom. </p>

  <figure>
  <img src="../images/IMG_7065.JPG" alt="" />
  </figure>

  <p>Otherwise, the first thing to catch my attention is the spear the Angel uses to strike the dragon, because of its remarkably white and unlined appearance, tearing diagonally through the page.</p>

  <p>Despite the print showing such an action-packed scene, about 1/5 of the composition is dedicated to showing the surrounding landscape, which can tell us something about Dürer’s environment and the values important to him.</p>

  <p>First thing to notice, is most of the landscape is still natural. Apart from that, we see: a city (it’s safe to assume it’s representing Nurnberg, or at least Nurnberg was the model), so: city state as the core element of civilisation. Next to the city, we see two ships on a lake, going to what seems to be another, far-off settlement. So, trade, as a way of communicating and exchanging with the rest of the world. Next, in the city and just outside of it, we see two church towers. Next to the protective city walls, the presence of churches is on of the most visible elements of the man-made landscape.</p>

  <p>Despite the scene being biblical, we are able to see the structure of Dürer’s world: a network of well-guarded cities of Nürnberg, Koln, Bern, etc.</p>

  <p>The next print I have seen were the <em>‌The Four Horsemen</em>. Admittedly, I wasn't so up to date on my Bible knowledge – I always preferred fantasy that kept up an earnest distance to it being fictional. So I wasn't immediately sure what I was looking at. But, by analysing what we can see in the image, we can see what Dürer is trying to communicate. Each of the riders is carrying a different weapon, which is surely not accidental. While just by looking, three of the horsemen could be read as heroic characters – but the fourth one odd, clearly sticking out from the rest in the composition as well as in his menacing look, suggest a sinister side of the group, which in the connection to the Apocalypse, made me realise I'm looking at the Four Horsemen.</p>

  </figure>

  <p>The third print I've seen, was <em>‌The Vision of the Seven</em> Candlesticks. Here, Dürer again leaves a lot of visual clues. St. Johns kneeling position, clasped hands and bare feet suggest his submission to the almighty God, of course shown as an old, wise man. Everywhere we see the symbolism of number seven, important in the Apocalypse. Apart from his place in the composition, and an authoritative seated position, it is worth noting what are the visible symbols of God's power: eyes surrounded by fire, 7 stars surrounding his right hand, a sword sticking out of his mouth and a book in the left hand.</p>

  <p>The last print I have seen, <em>Melancholy</em>, marks the shift into the early Renaissance, both visually and thematically. At this point, Dürer refined his woodcut line work into an absurd point, achieving much more 'realistic' (for our eyes) rendering. The melancholic figure is surrounded by symbols that refer to &quot;liberal arts&quot;: grammar, logic, rhetoric, mathematics, music, astronomy.<sup><a href="#fn20-9219" id="fnr20-9219" title="see footnote" class="footnote">20</a></sup></p>
