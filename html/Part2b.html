  <h2>Rise of the Nerds</h2>

  <p>Tolkien's unlikely heroes and anti-war themes, which were also read as anti-nuclear, gained him a following among students in the 1960s, mainly in American campuses. While other fantasy authors followed in his footsteps, a separate interest grew in collective storytelling.</p>

  <p>Heavily inspired by Tolkien’s world, <em>Dungeons and Dragons</em>, first board game, and then tabletop roleplaying game, has been released in 1974. The books outlined a fictional fantasy world, its lore and creatures, spells and character classes. The games had a fantasy setting imposed onto them, but they encouraged storytelling for players, and creating their own personal characters. </p>

  <p>“Herds of nerds” loved the game, but with its popularity concerns of parents rose. It was called “the most effective introduction to the occult in the history of man”. The fact that teenagers were fantasising about magic and swords sparked controversy in the USA, especially among Christian groups, such as B.A.D.D. (Bothered About Dungeons and Dragons). <sup><a href="#fn28-9219" id="fnr28-9219" title="see footnote" class="footnote">28</a></sup></p>

  <p>Recognising that my personal experience with ‘paper’ roleplaying games has been very sporadic, I thought that it would be best to have a talk with someone with better experience on the topic. I've thought about my friend Héloïse d'Almeida, a French graphic designer, who I remembered being so dedicated to <em>Dungeons and Dragons</em>, that she was playing it with her friends through Skype (before it was the common way). While in Burgundy for the lockdown, she was kind enough to answer a few questions.</p>

  <p>As Heloise puts it, the world setting of Dungeons and Dragons is &quot;European Middle Ages, as seen as Americans, that weren't there&quot;, where a millennia worth's of history has been playfully mixed into a single entity, with Dragons thrown on top. Seems about right. </p>

  <p>The interesting thing is that she has no teenage nostalgia towards RPGs—when I first met her a year and a half ago, she has been playing for only two months. She first got into it by accident, by looking for videos on YouTube that she could listen to while working, and the 4 hour-long podcasts of D&amp;D play sessions were perfect, as they didn't require constant concentration. After that initial interest, Heloise and her sisters found a group of players in their neighbourhood in Paris, that were meeting every week for sessions.</p>

  <p>A big difference, in comparison to European history, that Héloïse points out is the way language is used: as all items, spells, weapons, etc. have to be clearly understandable in the game, Latin is substituted for very simple and descriptive names. For example, a potion that increases the strength of your character would be called &quot;Potion Of Giant Strength&quot;, as Giants are obviously very strong.</p>

  <p>Something that helps in keeping the link to Medieval history, is the game's strong reliance on the book medium. Here, the book serves two purposes: as the rules grew more and more complex over time, it was the only possible way to collect all this information, pre-Internet era. But, with their suggestive illustrations and skeuomorphic graphics, the game manuals also sparked imagination, and made the player feel like they were shuffling through the manuscripts of old. While most of the game resources are now available online, which is great for accessibility, Heloise admits that it doesn't carry the same emotional load, and she still shares a set of books between her friends. Which she does as the books are expensive to buy, but it also reinforces the link between the playing group. And, its a refreshing thing to care for something so deeply with your friends, as a counter to the throw-away culture.</p>

  <p>One set of books makes sense within roles that the players assume: one takes on the role of the Game (or Dungeon) Master, and others the roles of Player Characters. The Player Character is a single entity, that the player tries to role-play as, trying to imagine its personality, goals and decisions. As the games are mostly spoken, except for dice rolls and maps, the Dungeon Master takes care of the rest of the story: the narration, the world setting, the non-playable characters. </p>

  <p>For Héloïse, all of the complex and detailed combat rules, which can even detail up to a single inch what your character is doing, should only serve as a backdrop for the Game Master to create funny and interesting situations, an hour-long elaborate joke for the players to share, shared memories of things that didn't really happen. </p>

  <p>In the aspect of character role-play, Héloïse found that she prefers to play as characters which share some personality traits with her own – for example having a chaotic moral alignment, which often allows her to look for ways to bend the rules, which she says is similar to how she acts herself. On the other hand, playing as a lawful character proves to be too slow and confusing. (The rules of Dungeon and Dragons give the player a now well known chart of 9 moral alignments to choose from, with Good, Neutral, Evil on one axis, and Lawful, Neutral and Chaotic on the other. Two neutrals result in the True Neutral alignment). </p>

  <p>Being on the other side of the Game Master screen, not only requires a great deal of preparation in the story and attention in keeping track of players actions, but can also be very unpredictable. Heloise clued me in how a Game Master can subtly direct the players by giving an illusion of choice, or leaving multiple clues towards one direction. On the other hand, the unpredictability is what sets the game apart – she mentioned a great moment, when, after being used more linear storylines, one realises what they can do with their characters is theoretically endless. </p>
