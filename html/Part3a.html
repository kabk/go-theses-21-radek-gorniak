  <h1>The Abstraction</h1>

  <blockquote>
  <p>“We might conclude that, if the human experiment was aimed at the expanding the sphere of rationality and reducing chaos, the human experiment is over. The very tools that enabled the expansion of rationality and human control (science, technology, industry, and information) have subsumed life to abstraction. And living warmth can only be found outside the icy walls of the citadel of reason.” F. Bernardi </p>

  <p>How are the afterimages seen while sailing the uncharted waters of the Internet? </p>

  <p>It seems to me that we find ourselves beyond the stage of Monty Python's subverting and playing with established cliches. The associations about Middle Ages are still there, but the excess of information overloads the meaning – the historical imagery is remixed into a memetic purgatory. Taken out of context, remixed and reappropriated. </p>

  <p>Here, the absurd and repetition create a myth. When previously, the afterimages were used to create harmony, to fabricate a deeper backstory, now they are used for creating tension and unease.</p>

    <h2>Algorithmic Storytelling</h2>

    <p>In case of modern example of the afterimage, we can observe a multi-layer cake of nostalgia, starting from history, through fantasy literature and early role-playing games. </p>

    <p>Because D&amp;D and subsequent fantasy games started gaining popularity in the USA and then rest of the world in the 1980s, they were a perfect inspiration for the developing market of video games, mainly home console and computer games. Whereas ‘classical’ paper and pen roleplaying games required free-form, abstract thinking from its players, the computer ones focused more on structure and logic.</p>

    <p>Today, those early computer games are referenced in another layer of nostalgia, in based on algorithmic structures and machine-learning.</p>

    <p><em>Dwarf Fortress</em>, one of such examples, is a dungeon-manager simulator at its core.<sup><a href="#fn30-9219" id="fnr30-9219" title="see footnote" class="footnote">30</a></sup> By default, the game is made purely of ASCII characters, so until a player uploads a graphical texture package, most that you see are letters and symbols of different colours (a perfect game for a typographer?). So, visually, not only is your imagination directed to something older because of the medieval setting, but also because of the 1980s aesthetics. A double afterimage. </p>

    <p>The familiarity also helps to create a sense of immersion much quicker, despite the archaic interface. This is brought further before the game proper starts. Before you gather your team of trusty dwarves, you go through the process of world building. Simulation runs, every time randomly generating geography, history, etc. through the passage of time. From the created world, you only occupy a small chunk of it. What took Tolkien his whole creative life, here can be generated in just a few seconds. </p>

    <p>Another example that I found is the web browser game <em>AI Dungeon</em>.<sup><a href="#fn31-9219" id="fnr31-9219" title="see footnote" class="footnote">31</a></sup> Here, the user interface is very minimal, in principle it is a text based game, reminiscent of the old text adventure games, created at American universities in the 1970s, often as a showcase of the possible computing power of new machines.</p>

    <p>As you might have deducted from the name, there is a crucial difference in how the text read by the player is generated. In the older games, the programmers had to write all the possible situations that the player might encounter. Also, a very specific list of actions that the player can choose from was crucial – there could be no misunderstandings, for the story to go forward.</p>

    <p>In the case of the <em>AI Dungeon</em>, there is no preset stories, and no pre-determined actions that you have to choose from. You do have to choose from a few possible world settings (such as Fantasy, Cyberpunk, Apocalyptic, etc.) and then a character within that setting. In the case of Fantasy—you can choose from the usual suspects: a Knight, a Wizard, a Princess, etc. Then, the AI is your Game Master, introducing you to the story and the world in a few sentences. Then, you can freely type what your character might do, say, or you might even fill some of the story by yourself.</p>

    <p>As impressive as it is coding-wise, in the end you could say that the &quot;game&quot; is simply a glorified, way more elaborate chatbot. But, as in many previous examples, the historical afterimages act as a key into your imagination, to help you submerge in the fantasy. </p>

    <p>The difference is that in both games, the element of a personal interaction is taken out, as you are not reading deep thoughts of a book author, or you are not collectively dreaming with other nerds sitting next to you. Or that's how it might seem, as in the end the algorithms in question didn't fall out the sky, they were also written by human beings. What's the difference then? It might be the removal of a tactile objects (no books, no dice, etc.), or it might be simply my bias because of knowing that I am looking at something automatically generated, and not considerably made.</p>

    <h2>Afterimages in art</h2>

    <p>I have commented on a lot of visual material, many of which could be considered different forms of &quot;graphic design&quot;. But what about art, in its pure form? How can those afterimages be used?</p>

    <p>Wanting to be less broad and more specific, I've reached out to a friend of mine – Laura Nicholson, an artist based in London. They live and breathe art theory, which proved to be helpful in legitimising my arguments, after our talk. Also what also came to my mind are the fantasy motifs that they use in their insanely detailed and satisfying to watch work. </p>

    <p>Knowing that Laura comes from the USA, but then studied and lived for some time now in England, I thought it would be a good opportunity to check how much of my assumptions in this text could be only limited to Northern Europe. What I didn't expect is that as a kid, Laura was going to &quot;really, really rural Ireland&quot; every summer, where they could see things that predate written history, that European mythology rests on something &quot;other&quot;.</p>

    <p>Literary classic like the King Arthur tales were also present, and the Brother Grimm tales were the first thing that their mother read to them – which later made Disney movies shocking, as no one had their feet cut off, and there was no blood.</p>

    <p>For Laura, these tales harked back to something more solid than what they could find in the America, because of it being &quot;deeply ahistorical&quot;. However, Europeanness was not something in and of itself, but a valuableness that came from it being non-American.
    Coming back to America and declaring &quot;I JUST CAME FROM EUROPE&quot; was an identity within the American one. Laura's interest in Europe's history wasn't so much because it was European, but because it was older. As Native American history has been annihilated, the only way to get a sense of things happening over time in the flow of them, is to go to Europe. Europe is where history happens for America. </p>

    <p>The idea of Europe also allowed for reflection on the harshness of the American capitalism, it was the dangerous and kinky place where communism might be possible. (Laura admits that one of their first drawings were big titted women with huge communist symbols, as it was something exotic.) </p>

    <p>When asked about the fantasy themes in their art, Laura acknowledges that part of it is personal and part of it is just they enjoy drawing, and she might not find the rational for it until years after it had been drawn.</p>

    <p>Otherwise, a lot of the stuff comes from around mirror neurons and the idea that you will project yourself or be easily find yourself in relation to the human body. They always try to work with images that people can find themselves in relation to, and then play with those images. They like to combine porn with surgery videos, with popular culture coming into a mix that is hopefully nausea inducing. And it has to be recognisable for it to be nausea inducing, to feel strange. Because if it's too strange, then it's just strange. Most of it is informed by the combination of comic books and traditional painting, mixed in with techniques based on the body.</p>

    <p>When I pointed out how precise Laura was, in contrast to the vague question I have asked, I got back a classic quote: &quot;I have to have a lot of precision, because I am a mess.&quot; </p>
