  <h1>Part 3: The Abstraction</h1>

  <blockquote>
  <p>“We might conclude that, if the human experiment was aimed at the expanding the sphere of rationality and reducing chaos, the human experiment is over. The very tools that enabled the expansion of rationality and human control (science, technology, industry, and information) have subsumed life to abstraction. And living warmth can only be found outside the icy walls of the citadel of reason.” F. Bernardi </p>

  <p>How are the afterimages seen while sailing the uncharted waters of the Internet? </p>

  <p>It seems to me that we find ourselves beyond the stage of Monty Python's subverting and playing with established cliches. The associations about Middle Ages are still there, but the excess of information overloads the meaning – the historical imagery is remixed into a memetic purgatory. Taken out of context, remixed and reappropriated. </p>

  <p>Here, the absurd and repetition create a myth. When previously, the afterimages were used to create harmony, to fabricate a deeper backstory, now they are used for creating tension and unease.</p>
