  <h2>Afterimages in art</h2>

  <p>I have commented on a lot of visual material, many of which could be considered different forms of &quot;graphic design&quot;. But what about art, in its pure form? How can those afterimages be used?</p>

  <p>Wanting to be less broad and more specific, I've reached out to a friend of mine – Laura Nicholson, an artist based in London. They live and breathe art theory, which proved to be helpful in legitimising my arguments, after our talk. Also what also came to my mind are the fantasy motifs that they use in their insanely detailed and satisfying to watch work. </p>

  <p>Knowing that Laura comes from the USA, but then studied and lived for some time now in England, I thought it would be a good opportunity to check how much of my assumptions in this text could be only limited to Northern Europe. What I didn't expect is that as a kid, Laura was going to &quot;really, really rural Ireland&quot; every summer, where they could see things that predate written history, that European mythology rests on something &quot;other&quot;.</p>

  <p>Literary classic like the King Arthur tales were also present, and the Brother Grimm tales were the first thing that their mother read to them – which later made Disney movies shocking, as no one had their feet cut off, and there was no blood.</p>

  <p>For Laura, these tales harked back to something more solid than what they could find in the America, because of it being &quot;deeply ahistorical&quot;. However, Europeanness was not something in and of itself, but a valuableness that came from it being non-American.
  Coming back to America and declaring &quot;I JUST CAME FROM EUROPE&quot; was an identity within the American one. Laura's interest in Europe's history wasn't so much because it was European, but because it was older. As Native American history has been annihilated, the only way to get a sense of things happening over time in the flow of them, is to go to Europe. Europe is where history happens for America. </p>

  <p>The idea of Europe also allowed for reflection on the harshness of the American capitalism, it was the dangerous and kinky place where communism might be possible. (Laura admits that one of their first drawings were big titted women with huge communist symbols, as it was something exotic.) </p>

  <p>When asked about the fantasy themes in their art, Laura acknowledges that part of it is personal and part of it is just they enjoy drawing, and she might not find the rational for it until years after it had been drawn.</p>

  <p>Otherwise, a lot of the stuff comes from around mirror neurons and the idea that you will project yourself or be easily find yourself in relation to the human body. They always try to work with images that people can find themselves in relation to, and then play with those images. They like to combine porn with surgery videos, with popular culture coming into a mix that is hopefully nausea inducing. And it has to be recognisable for it to be nausea inducing, to feel strange. Because if it's too strange, then it's just strange. Most of it is informed by the combination of comic books and traditional painting, mixed in with techniques based on the body.</p>

  <p>When I pointed out how precise Laura was, in contrast to the vague question I have asked, I got back a classic quote: &quot;I have to have a lot of precision, because I am a mess.&quot; </p>
