<p>I think hard times are coming when we will be wanting the voices of writers who can see alternatives to how we live now and can see through our fear-stricken society and its obsessive technologies. We will need writers who can remember freedom.

<h2>A foreword: The Afterimage</h2>

<p>Take a good look at an image, best if it’s a very specific shape, on a contrasting background. If you stare at the centre of it for about 30 seconds, trying to relax your eyes and look “beyond” it, and then look at a blank wall, you’re still going to see it floating in front of your eyes, burned into your retina. While you can still make out the general shape of it, the form is already getting blurry. The colours are inverted into a weird cyan-green, that doesn’t seem to exist in nature. After a few seconds the image now completely dissipates.</p>

<p>I am interested in where, and in what way can we see such visual themes, mainly focusing on the literary genre of fantasy, and its connection to the European Middle Ages. We can find these afterimages in some of the most popular contemporary books, movies and TV shows. Despite things changing around us in a pace that makes the world impossible to understand, and technology ruling our world more and more, we are still attracted to magic and swords. </p>

<p>Is this phenomenon a reaction to a world where everything is known through science, and there’s little use for magic? Or, is it an attraction towards storytelling structures, that have so clearly defined conflicts and resolutions, as opposed to our complex lives? And, why does fantasy rely so much on Euro-centric symbols? </p>

<p>The fantasy genre is also directly connected to the rise of narrative driven video games, as both crept into the mainstream from the basements of nerd culture of the 1980s and 90s. Today, fantasy video games promise free-roaming adventures in lush, virtual worlds. Next to science fiction and superhero stories, fantasy can be considered one of the pillars of mass-consumed fictional media.</p>

<p>After 500 years have passed, what are the afterimages of Medieval times that still linger in the collective retina? And, how do they influence the graphical language of today?</p>

<h1>PART 1: The History</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>When we speak of <em>history</em>, when we view events from a historical perspective, we are imposing a certain modulation of our perception and projection of time. Historical perception shapes time into an all-encompassing dimension that forces individuals and groups to share their temporalities according to a uniform meter and a teleological (or economic) frame. People enter the historical domain when they all hear more or less the same music in their ears.—F. Bernardi <sup><a href="#fn2-17234" id="fnr2-17234" title="see footnote" class="footnote">2</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Middle Point</h2>

<p>What do we understand by saying <em>Middle Ages</em>? Usually, the period that falls roughly between the years 300 and 1500 A.D., stuck between the apparent wonders of the ancient cultures of Greece and Rome, and the classical rationale reborn in the European renaissance. It is often stereotyped as a period of stagnation and misery. It is in the name itself – the <em>Dark</em> Ages, or the <em>medieval</em>, from the Latin <em>medium aevum</em>, a <em>Middle Age</em><sup><a href="#fn3-17234" id="fnr3-17234" title="see footnote" class="footnote">3</a></sup>. While a <em>Dark</em> Age describes the period quite clearly in a negative light, the <em>Middle</em> goes beyond that—it suggests that it is a moment only defined by more notable things that have happened before, and have come afterwards.</p>

<p>In his book <em>Medieval Bodies</em>, art historian Jack Hartnell, who, by his own definition, deals with revealing the Middle Ages from its warped impression, brings up a public survey done by a major London museum. The visitors were asked to imagine themselves living in the Medieval and Renaissance periods, and describe what they might have felt or seen. As expected, people responded positively to the Renaissance: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I’m in Florence walking by the river at midday. It’s peaceful, I’m smiling. I’m an artist’s model and he’s sculpting the Madonna and Child. The sunshine sparkles, there’s a little glade and a little lake. There’s philosophy, people sitting round talking about politics, books. Music … I want to stay and dream.
</p>
</blockquote>

</figure>

<p>In a stark contrast, ideas about the Middle Ages were rather bleak:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are soldiers, peasants, high castles, muddy lowlands … Black Death and Plague are all around. It’s raining. People are drunk on mead and fighting among themselves. The artists are not respected. I’m in a dungeon wearing a potato sack and it’s night. It’s cold, there are rats. The windows have bars at floor level. I stole some potatoes for your newborn child.” <sup><a href="#fn4-17234" id="fnr4-17234" title="see footnote" class="footnote">4</a></sup> </p>
</blockquote>

<figcaption><em>De triomf van de Doods</em> (The Triumph of Death), by Pieter Bruegel the Elder (1562). A common afternoon in the Medieval Netherlands.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Here we can see how stereotypes of historical periods are disconnected from the reality of place (we are always in Florence), the elements (it’s always raining), and history itself (potatoes came to Europe only from America in 1570).</p>

<p>There are two main reasons to justify describing the period as <em>Dark</em>. One would be a small amount of written records in the Early Middle Ages. The other is an apparent loss of Classical Greek texts, which were in fact preserved, but outside of Europe.</p>

<p>Understanding Middle Ages is the problem not only of the time, in terms of agreeing on specific time boundaries, but also of space—while a lot of assumptions about the time are (western) Euro-centric, Jack Hartnell argues that it should be rather seen as a period of intense interaction (both positive and negative), between the inheritors of the legacy of the Roman Empire: the emerging European states, the Byzantine Empire, and the Islamic World.<sup><a href="#fn5-17234" id="fnr5-17234" title="see footnote" class="footnote">5</a></sup></p>

<p>Maps of the world reflected this – showing the structure of the world as a connection of Africa, Asia and Europe, with Jerusalem (or sometimes Constantinople) in the middle, as the <em>axis mundi</em>, or the central axis of the world. </p>

</figure>

<p>While the negative viewpoint on the period was maintained by the so-called rational reformers that came later in history, it might have its origins in the Late Medieval period itself. The Italian author Francesco Petrarch, considered to be one of the earliest thinkers of the Renaissance, wrote around 1350 in his <em>‌Epistolae familiares</em>: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>“There was a more fortunate age and probably there will be one again; in the middle, in our time, you see the confluence of wretches and ignominy… &quot; <sup><a href="#fn6-17234" id="fnr6-17234" title="see footnote" class="footnote">6</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>He later expanded on his dark and edgy views in his grand poem <em>Africa</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;My fate is to live among varied and confusing storms. But for you perhaps, if, as I hope and wish, you will live long after me, there will follow a better age. When the darkness has been dispersed, our descendants can come again into the former pure radiance.” <sup><a href="#fn7-17234" id="fnr7-17234" title="see footnote" class="footnote">7</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Seeing how much his sentiment resonates with me in connection to the varied and confusing storms of today, I do wonder if some comparisons could be drawn between ours and Petrarch’s times. Or, as he was a great scholar of Cicero (a writer from Ancient Rome), perhaps it is a common feeling to have, when looking into history of periods that have passed.</p>

<h2>Theory of Seeing</h2>

<p>To better understand what are the Medieval afterimages, I would like to start at the beginning (or rather in the middle), and briefly look at the visual source material from the time, with a little help from an expert. </p>

<p>Personally, I have been drawn to the period because of the many contradictions that surround it and its “middle” infamy. It was quite a clear beginning of the way modern European states are shaped. It marked the appearance of the first universities, and established a strong tradition in the use of reason. Despite this, it still retains a certain strangeness and &quot;darkness&quot;. I think that this contradiction is best seen in visual arts from the period.</p>

<figcaption><em>À Mon Seul Désir</em>, one of the six Cluny tapestries, completed around the year 1500.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>On one hand, we can observe gold decorated manuscripts, rich tapestries, monumental churches. On the other, I can’t help but laugh at the crude and symbolic compositions with an almost non existent perspective, especially baffling when keeping in mind the preceding hellenistic paintings and the succeeding renaissance ones. Looking at them today, it's difficult to determine what was done as a joke, or did people back then really believe that knights fought snails, and men, whose heads did grow beneath their shoulders, roamed the Earth. It has been a long-unanswered mystery for me.</p>

</figure>

<p>While I don't think there's a simple, hidden answer for that question, I have gained a better understanding for why was Medieval art the way that it was. The biggest help in that process has been <em>Theory of Seeing</em>, a book by Władysław Strzemiński, which I found precious not only because of it showing history of art in an atypical manner, but also it being available only in Polish. Because of that, and because his line of reasoning is confusing at best, I will try to slowly explain the general idea. </p>

<p>I love off-topic backstories to a fault, so here's one: Władysław Strzemiński (1893–1952) was a polymath in a true sense go the word—he had a technical engineering education, he was a successful avant-garde painter (he studied under Kazimir Malevich), and at the end of his life, he was a prominent professor at the Academy of Fine Arts in Łódź, which today bears his name. On top of that, he developed an interest in the physical aspects of eyesight, mainly because of World War I injuries he suffered. <em>Theory of Seeing</em> was supposed to combine all of those interests into one work, but in a true fashion of a Polish tragedy, he passed away after World War II, ostracised by the communist establishment, before fully completing the book<sup><a href="#fn8-17234" title="see footnote" class="footnote">8</a></sup>. </p>

<p>At the beginning of the book, Strzemiński starts simple enough, by looking at history of art not as an isolated process, but in close connection to societal structures, technological advancements and other historical turmoils. He states that since ancient civilisations have formed, our actual eyesight, in a biological sense, has not evolved.<sup><a href="#fn9-17234" id="fnr9-17234" title="see footnote" class="footnote">9</a></sup> Yet, we can observe a growing visual awareness in how eyesight was used, in arts, throughout history: starting with contour vision of the paleolit, through silhouette vision, to the perspective discoveries of the renaissance. He accentuates that our notions of realism in art have changed, and that the process of a growing visual awareness is a reflection of historical progress<sup><a href="#fn10-17234" id="fnr10-17234" title="see footnote" class="footnote">10</a></sup>. </p>

<p>In a way, it sounds very obvious. Yes, art did become more complex as civilisations became more developed. But, by framing art history not only as styles that just &quot;happened&quot; in a vacuum, Strzemiński creates interesting connections. </p>

</figure>

<p>For example, he explains why in so many cultures we can observe a transformation from free-form linear drawings<sup><a href="#fn11-17234" id="fnr11-17234" title="see footnote" class="footnote">11</a></sup> (think cave drawings) into monumental, rhythmical and ornamental art. The common element in these cultures, such as Egypt, Mesopotamia, Peru and India, was a close relationship to controlling water sources, as well as the supremacy of the priesthood caste. Their dependency on calendars to predict flooding and optimal harvest times, as well as keeping complex irrigation systems required strict and competent governance.<sup><a href="#fn12-17234" id="fnr12-17234" title="see footnote" class="footnote">12</a></sup></p>

<p>Let's look at a visual example from Ancient Egypt: the Narmer Palette, dated to be around 5000 years old. Looking at one of its sides, we can clearly see the king, the representative of priesthood rule. Standing below the heads of gods, not only is his silhouette is the biggest one, but also the most distinctive one, with a crown on his head, and symbols of power in his hands. All other human beings, especially his decapitated victims, are repeated and devoid of personality, reflecting the structure of society in Egypt.</p>

<figcaption>the Narmer Palette, dated to be around 5000 years old.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The crazy Strzemiński goes further. In order to explain some of the pattern-like, rhythmical qualities of ancient art, he introduces the concept of &quot;architectonisation&quot;: a process of connecting shapes of objects across mediums, and creating a rhythmical relationship between them. Sculpture and pottery. Architecture and painting<sup><a href="#fn13-17234" id="fnr13-17234" title="see footnote" class="footnote">13</a></sup>.</p>

<figcaption>Columns of the Doric order at the Parthenon, Athens</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>It gets even better: as before, Strzemiński doesn't look at this process as something disconnected from physical reality, and reality of seeing. For him, a reason for such fluid &quot;spilling&quot; of forms and shapes across objects, is the phenomenon of the afterimage. Having a pattern burned into your retina for a few seconds, and then seeing it again in a different object makes you feel harmony, makes you feel beauty<sup><a href="#fn14-17234" id="fnr14-17234" title="see footnote" class="footnote">14</a></sup>.</p>

<p>So, how does it all connect to Medieval art? </p>

<p>When describing the Middle Ages, at first Strzemiński points out the apparent: the seeming &quot;fall&quot; of civilisation with the decline of the Hellenic Roman-Greek culture. Looking at it today, we might view the Late Hellenic art as &quot;realistic&quot;: it used three-dimensional perspective, and subtly complex colours, usually to show material qualities of commodities<sup><a href="#fn15-17234" id="fnr15-17234" title="see footnote" class="footnote">15</a></sup>. </p>

<figure>

<figcaption><em>Dove Mosaic</em>, found in Hadrian's Villa in Italy. Dated to be around 1800 years old.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>When the Medieval age rolled in, the continuity of progression in art has been broken. In some areas, the Romanesque art of Northern and Central Europe regressed to primitive silhouette art, or even at times line art, which corresponds with the art of the early Ancient Egypt, with around 4000 years of difference in between<sup><a href="#fn16-17234" id="fnr16-17234" title="see footnote" class="footnote">16</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Staying on the level of a formal analysis (ie. one that analyses only the elements of the form), it can be said that both art of the Middle Ages and Ancient Egypt uses “intentional perspective”, where scale of an individual represents their importance in the social hierarchy (like in the earlier example of the Narmer Palette).<sup><a href="#fn17-17234" id="fnr17-17234" title="see footnote" class="footnote">17</a></sup> But to explain why the societies of Early Middle Ages also used that perspective, Strzemiński goes away from formal analysis and back to his definition of visual awareness: as a reflection of reality of a given point in time, that a given society reached at that point. </p>

<p>So, similarities should be looked for also in structures of societies: after the fall of the Roman Empire, Medieval Europe was ruled by the priesthood class, similar to early Antiquity.</p>

<p>Architectonisation, the transfer of shapes through afterimage, also makes a comeback. In both Romanesque and Byzantine art the square serves as the often repeated element, the base for architectural constructions and painting compositions.<sup><a href="#fn18-17234" id="fnr18-17234" title="see footnote" class="footnote">18</a></sup></p>

<p>But, to make a bold statement, Middle Ages were not the Antiquity, despite the initial similarities. Before, it took thousands of years to come from silhouette drawings to the Hellenic perspective. This time, it took a few hundred years at most. Instead of thinking of the Medieval period as a &quot;dead&quot; one, Strzemiński argues that it was one of the most accelerated periods of reconstructing society on top of a new, feudal structure. <sup><a href="#fn19-17234" id="fnr19-17234" title="see footnote" class="footnote">19</a></sup></p>

<h2>Living History</h2>

<h3>Afterimages in surroundings</h3>

<figcaption><em>Das hailig römisch reich mit sampt seinen gelidern</em>, The Holy Roman Empire including its members, woodcut and watercolour by Jost de Negker (1510)</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>As I found out during the research for this text, by starting to dig into history you can almost never stop with following a thread back and back through time. Still, it has become clear to me how the period of Middle Ages seems to be the cradle of today’s Europe, the region that has been my home both physically and culturally. Understanding that period better has helped to understand the state of affairs today. </p>

<p>Its afterimage is still visible today. It was the period that established Christian dominance in the region. While in countries like the Netherlands or Germany its strong influence is well hidden under apparently secular statehoods, in countries like Poland, where I'm from, it is much more direct.</p>

<p>I remember very well from history lessons that the moment considered to be the beginning of the history of Poland was its baptism in 966 A.D. Almost over a 1000 years later, it was still seen as a moment defining the whole country’s identity. Throughout many dynasties, political systems and hostile invasions, Christianity was portrayed as the stable element throughout Polish history. Despite Poland being a secular state in theory, you can see a crucifix in all institutions of the state, such as courts and schools.</p>

<p>But European landscape is not only shaped by religion, but also by state power and commerce. Apart from Christian elements, I was able to observe many Medieval afterimages during my internship period in Berlin, for example when conducting extensive research on the long tradition of local German beers. Here, blackletter typography and labels that refer to old guild emblems are supposed to give the product a sense of historical legitimacy. </p>

<figure>

<figcaption>Label of the <em>Augsburger Original</em> </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Similarly, across many European cities we can still observe coats of arms, flags, or different heraldic symbols with that refer to the Medieval past. For example, Berlin’s coat of arms is a black bear, a symbol that can be traced back almost 800 years back. </p>

<p>Being in Berlin also helped me to use the cities resources available, and visit local archives and libraries, and see more specific examples of living Medieval history. </p>

<h3>Liber Chronicarum</h3>

<p>On the 30th of October 2020, the last possible day before it was closed off to non-university users, I managed to reserve a time slot in the library of the Humboldt University in Berlin. It’s an impressive building, funnily enough called the Jacob-und-Wilhelm-Grimm-Zentrum. When I studied architecture, I remember staring for hours at the photographs of its grand reading room, accentuated by a square construction grid, with a void space that spans 5 floors. And I finally ended up here, in the strangest circumstances. After a bit of back and forth with the reception, regarding my lack of necessary library cards, I arrived at the 6th floor (above the void-reading room), in the Historical Collections room. Even before going in, I already had a feeling that I shouldn’t be there, that I was trespassing in some secret governmental archive. It was hard to believe that I was let inside, just thanks to a few e-mails, and no money taken from me. Being so used to having to pay for everything, even for some of the PDFs that I have read for writing this text, it feels very strange to be able to see such important cultural artefacts, entirely for free.</p>

<p>I had requested to see a copy of the Nurnberg Chronicle, a “compendium of universal history”, a brainchild of Hartmann Schedel (1440–1514), a doctor in Nurnberg. It is one of the most densely illustrated and technically advanced works of early printing. It is also notable for having one of the first woodcuts made by Albrecht Dürer. The specific copy that I was able to see has been printed in 1493, merely 50 years after Johannes Gutenberg started using movable type for printing. After the necessary clearances and preparations, I was able to look through the book freely, spending as much time as I saw fit.</p>

<p>Seeing the book in front of my eyes, made me notice completely different things than looking at scans on the screen, even the high quality ones. First of all, the size of it makes a big difference—each page is about A3, or even bigger in size. That made me less focused on the spread as a singe image, but instead I started reading it as a collection of elements, often quite well detailed. For instance, looking at the scans on the screen I would never have noticed that while the text is set with movable type (you can see repeated letter forms), the lettering in the woodcuts is custom made, and a part of the illustration. </p>

<figure>
<img src="IMAGES/LIBRARY%20PHOTOS/IMG_3191.JPG" alt="Custom vs. Typeset letters" />
<figcaption>Custom vs. Typeset letters</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Each woodcut became a collection of lines, which immediately de-mystified the book for me, instead of some strange, other worldly object, it became something that a human being could actually produce. </p>

<p>Not that it made the thing less impressive, or diminished its importance for me. Touching the paper from 600 years ago, even if through the gloves (that is until the lady at the desk looked somewhere else), can be only a spiritual experience.</p>

</figure>

<p>Having the book in front of me, all to my disposal, in a highly guarded building, wearing white gloves, made me think of a coroner about to conduct an autopsy. Or rather, of a scholar of the arcane, about to unravel some awesome secret. There were no websites to summarise and categorise the object, no descriptions to skew my interpretation, no experts to guide my attention. The only “facts” I could rely on was the knowledge I already had, and the empirical observations that I could conduct. </p>

<p>The thing that has been de-mystified the most for me, was the books purpose, or rather the bulk of its contents. In the end, after an introduction that describes the creation of the world (which of course is based on the Bible, as apparently the did not hear about the “rational” Renaissance being around the corner), most of the book is actually a description of cities in the Holy Roman Empire, and the noble families that had lived in them.</p>

<p>At the end of the book, I stumbled upon Wrocław, the city in Poland that I was born in. Seeing it in such an old account made me full realise that history did, in fact, happen. By holding history in my hands, it stopped being a vague annoyance preached by teachers in schools, but an actual cycle of generations, existing for hundred thousand years before me. </p>

<figure>

<p>Coming from a country with an eroded sense of continuity, and having lived in many different places myself, it becomes even more important to find such a proof of historical legitimacy, as a counter to the liquid modernity of today.

Feeling a rush of excitement, I wanted to see more artefacts, while still in Berlin. Using the Nurnberg Chronicle as a starting point, I have gone to the Kupferstichkabinett, the Museum of Prints and Drawings in Berlin, to see original prints of Albrecht Dürer. </p>

<p>I think it’s interesting to look at Albrecht Dürer’s work, and other examples of the early printmaking, because of their existence on the border of the Medieval and the Renaissance periods. I could definitely see a difference in quality of his image-making, when comparing his earliest works I’ve seen (Nurnberg Chronicle) and latest (Melancholia). I would argue that his early works are an example of Medieval methodology, while using Renaissance technology. Apart from Melancholia, I've seen prints from Dürer's <em>Apocalypse</em> – a popular topic at the time, as people believed that we world would end in the year 1500. (The Nurnberg Chronicle itself has empty pages left at the end, for people to record the last years of the universe).</p>

<p>Again, seeing how important it is to see things in the flesh, or in the paper, felt like coming out of a long coma, and re-learning things that I knew well before. It is such a basic thing, it is easy for me to forget. It felt like a glass wall of the screen has been lifted in front of my eyes. A curtain lifted, transforming an image I was seeing as only that, an image, into a collection of exposed elements, ready for me to interpret. </p>

<p>The way I look at things, and the way my focus works, makes me rarely look beyond what I am seeing. I rarely analyse and interpret things on my own. Usually the form of an image is what interests me, not its meaning. </p>

<p>In comparison to my previous viewing, the Dürer prints were presented to me as single sheets, in a cardboard passepartout. No one in the building really spoke English, but I was able to communicate with a mix of basic German and English, as I had to receive detailed instructions how to handle the artworks. After signing some paperwork regarding the rights to the pictures I have taken, I was left all by myself with the drawings. Just me and Dürer. With the prints sitting on a small wooden easel, it felt like I was visiting an old friend locked away in prison. </p>

</figure>

<p>The first one I viewed was <em>Saint Michael Fighting the Dragon</em>, from The Apocalypse. At the beginning, I was simply amazed by the quality of the artwork, and overwhelmed by the fact of seeing the print in front of me, in my hand’s reach. After viewing the rest, I returned to it, to analyse it better. Because of my perverse interests in letters, the first thing to have caught my attention was Dürer’s famous composite monogram, sitting at the bottom. </p>

<figure>
<img src="IMAGES/DURER%20PHOTOS/IMG_7065.JPG" alt="Monogram of Albrecht Dürer" />
<figcaption>Monogram of Albrecht Dürer</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Otherwise, the first thing to catch my attention is the spear the Angel uses to strike the dragon, because of its remarkably white and unlined appearance, tearing diagonally through the page.</p>

<p>Despite the print showing such an action-packed scene, about 1/5 of the composition is dedicated to showing the surrounding landscape, which can tell us something about Dürer’s environment and the values important to him.</p>

<figure>
<img src="IMAGES/DURER%20PHOTOS/IMG_7079%202%20copy.JPG" alt="a glimpse into Dürer’s world" />
<figcaption>a glimpse into Dürer’s world</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>First thing to notice, is most of the landscape is still natural. Apart from that, we see: a city (it’s safe to assume it’s representing Nurnberg, or at least Nurnberg was the model), so: city state as the core element of civilisation. Next to the city, we see two ships on a lake, going to what seems to be another, far-off settlement. So, trade, as a way of communicating and exchanging with the rest of the world. Next, in the city and just outside of it, we see two church towers. Next to the protective city walls, the presence of churches is on of the most visible elements of the man-made landscape.</p>

<p>Despite the scene being biblical, we are able to see the structure of Dürer’s world: a network of well-guarded cities of Nürnberg, Koln, Bern, etc.</p>

</figure>

<p>The next print I have seen were the <em>‌The Four Horsemen</em>. Admittedly, I wasn't so up to date on my Bible knowledge – I always preferred fantasy that kept up an earnest distance to it being fictional. So I wasn't immediately sure what I was looking at. But, by analysing what we can see in the image, we can see what Dürer is trying to communicate. Each of the riders is carrying a different weapon, which is surely not accidental. While just by looking, three of the horsemen could be read as heroic characters – but the fourth one odd, clearly sticking out from the rest in the composition as well as in his menacing look, suggest a sinister side of the group, which in the connection to the Apocalypse, made me realise I'm looking at the Four Horsemen.</p>

<figcaption><em>‌The Vision of the Seven Candlesticks</em>, Albrecht Dürer (1498)</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The third print I've seen, was <em>‌The Vision of the Seven Candlesticks</em>. Here, Dürer again leaves a lot of visual clues. St. Johns kneeling position, clasped hands and bare feet suggest his submission to the almighty God, of course shown as an old, wise man. Everywhere we see the symbolism of number seven, important in the Apocalypse. Apart from his place in the composition, and an authoritative seated position, it is worth noting what are the visible symbols of God's power: eyes surrounded by fire, 7 stars surrounding his right hand, a sword sticking out of his mouth and a book in the left hand.</p>

</figure>

<p>The last print I have seen, <em>Melencolia I</em>, marks the shift into the early Renaissance, both visually and thematically. At this point, Dürer started using engravings in place of woodcuts, which allowed him to bring his line work into an absurd point, achieving much more 'realistic' rendering. The melancholic figure is surrounded by symbols that refer to &quot;liberal arts&quot;: grammar, logic, rhetoric, mathematics, music, astronomy<sup><a href="#fn20-17234" id="fnr20-17234" title="see footnote" class="footnote">20</a></sup>.</p>

<h2>Fantasy Tales</h2>

<p>So far, I have talked about European history and its interpretations, and about my experiences of living in Europe. However, looking at global pop culture today, you continue to see the Medieval afterimages. Asking friends that grew up in Brazil, USA or South Korea, confirms this—there seems to be some kind of shared imagination of fantasy tales, and visually it often harks back to some parts of the European iconography.</p>

<p>But, the Medieval influence has been reduced to icons and associations, their meaning transformed, according to the times they were being used. </p>

<p>As with Middle Ages, it’s hard to define specific dates when fantasy as a literary genre emerged, especially considering the long and ancient history of tales, filled with supernatural themes, and the vague distinction between what we could consider as &quot;religion&quot; and &quot;fiction&quot;.</p>

<p>However, in relation to the Medieval, it could be said that the Romantic period of the XIX century introduced what we would consider &quot;pre-fantasy&quot;<sup><a href="#fn21-17234" id="fnr21-17234" title="see footnote" class="footnote">21</a></sup>. It was a certain kind of nostalgia towards the supernatural, as a counteraction to the rational thinking of the Enlightenment, but carrying with Enlightenment’s perception of the Middle Ages as a period when imagination and the irrational ruled. </p>

<p>For some, the goal was to preserve tales which lived only through oral tradition–the German Brothers Grimm wrote down and reintroduced a lot of common folk stories, some of which have clear references to medievality, such as Snow White, the Sleeping Beauty, or Rapunzel.</p>

<p>In other cases, the Medieval afterimages were a a counter-reaction to the industrial revolution. An important example was the British author, socialist, artist and independent printer William Morris, that contributed to the Arts &amp; Crafts movement of the end of the XIX century. Morris had a deep admiration for the Middle Ages, which was reflected in the archaic language he used, to reference the old tales of romance. The period was also an inspiration for him in book production, as he was dissatisfied with the low-quality of mass-produced books of his time. The editions printed by him were richly decorated, and he incorporated the manuscript-like golden ratio for the page layout. His novel, <em>The Well at the World's End</em>, is an important early example of a story that not only talks about fantastical themes, but actually describes a purely fictional world different from our own<sup><a href="#fn22-17234" id="fnr22-17234" title="see footnote" class="footnote">22</a></sup>. </p>

<figure>
<img src="IMAGES/LITERATURE/The_Well_at_the_World's_End_MET_DP322253.jpg" alt="A spread from The Well at the World's End by William Morris (1896)" />
<figcaption>A spread from <em>The Well at the World's End</em> by William Morris (1896)</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Morris also based some of his literature more directly on historical sources. The one source that stands out are the legends surrounding the catastrophic annihilation of an early Germanic people, know as the Burgundians, in 436 A.D. by the Huns, which acted as mercenary agents of the Roman Emperor. <sup><a href="#fn23-17234" id="fnr23-17234" title="see footnote" class="footnote">23</a></sup></p>

<p>The heroic age for the Teutonic people were the chaotic fifth and sixth centuries, when the Roman Empire was slowly collapsing before the Northern barbarian tribes. The events rose to legends by oral tradition, and were written down first as the <em>Völsunga saga</em> in Nordic traditions, and then in High German as the <em>Nibelungenlied</em>. <sup><a href="#fn24-17234" id="fnr24-17234" title="see footnote" class="footnote">24</a></sup></p>

<p>Both accounts differ from each other, and reflect the differences of the cultures they’re coming form, as well as the time they were written—<em>the Völsunga saga</em> is much more raw and interlaced with Nordic Mythology, while the later German counterpart carries more of the courtly traditions of the late Middle Ages.</p>

<p>Something that both have in common is the presence of a magic ring which, along with a mythical treasure of the Nibelung clan, travels through many hands of heroes thirsty with greed (you might already expect where I am going with this).</p>

<p>Morris wrote of the Volsunga: “This is the great story of the North, which should be to all our race what the tale of Troy was to the Greeks.” His <em>The Story of Sigurd the Volsung and the Fall of the Niblungs</em> was his retelling of the tale.</p>

<p>We both know that there is something I've been avoiding so far, an ugly afterimage burned into the ground, that I have been trying turn my eyes from. All the talk about Teutonic mythologies, feelings of historical affirmation, national identities could be used for heinous purposes.</p>

<p>In 1876, the same year that Morris’ interpretation of the Nordic legend was published, Richard Wagner premiered a cycle of four operas, called the <em>The Ring of the Nibelung</em>. It is often cited as the first expression of the identity of the then recently unified German nation.<sup><a href="#fn25-17234" id="fnr25-17234" title="see footnote" class="footnote">25</a></sup> Wagner was very conscious of the links between politics and aesthetics of art. Here, he purposely used the key of Medieval tales, to unlock the imagination of Germany, as a supposedly superior nation. </p>

<p>It would be only in the mid-XX century, when the old ring legends would be reclaimed back, for less morally repellent uses.</p>

<h2>The Lord of the Ring</h2>

<p>After various of those &quot;pre-fantasy&quot; examples, fantasy is widely considered to have started with the emergence of pulp magazines in the 1920s, in the USA. Here, it was all about short, easy to digest stories, and flashy covers, which would sell well.</p>

<p>After the II World War, longer literary forms of fantasy became the main form, with <em>Lord of The Rings</em> proving the most popular. While the history of the fantasy genre consists of a number of different actors, and there isn’t a single point of creation, the legacy of J. R. R. Tolkien’s work cannot be overlooked. What set him apart from other (medieval) fantasy writers of his time, was the extent of the world building that he accomplished. Tolkien himself drew inspiration from all aspects of his life: from personal experiences, to his great knowledge about the European mythos. </p>

<p>Tolkien's work is a great example of a Medieval afterimage used in fiction, an example towards which I have been building up my case. The way that shapes and patterns visually &quot;spilled&quot; across different mediums in historical art, which we perceive as harmony, here can be seen, done in a linguistic way. Tolkien used his knowledge of European history and literature, in order to deconstruct elements that could emotionally resonate with his readers. It's not that he created simple backstories for his novels—he constructed a whole world with a complete mythology, history that spans millennia, different alphabets and languages, detailed geography maps. Only on top of that, he figured out what kind of story to tell, and wrote his epic. </p>

<figure>

<figcaption>Tolkien writing in one of the scripts he created, <em>Tengwar</em></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>What purpose does it all serve, for us, readers? Because of the language that Tolkien uses, and because of his fiction having roots in history, <em>Lord of the Rings</em> reads like something much older than it is. It is quite absurd—I know, in the back of my head, that I am reading fiction, written by an middle-aged English professor. But, when reading the book I feel like I was reading something much, much older. And thanks to Tolkien's attention to world building, we get a sense of something greater—in the end, the story presented in the book is only a small, last part in Middle Earth's history. </p>

<p>Still, the Eurocentrism of author, and the time he was writing in, is still visible in key elements of the story–most of the main protagonists are male and suggested to be white, and the racial structures of Middle Earth could be considered strange and xenophobic.</p>

<p>However, Tolkien introduces some themes which subvert the typically conservative ones. He was strongly opposed to both anti-semitism and apartheid, and in <em>Lord of the Rings</em> he presented the pitfalls of intolerance for being different, which lead to war and devastation. Furthermore in the story, which was written mostly during World War II, he presents a world dominated by violence, where arrogant masculinity has failed. His interest in Medieval heroines is reflected in a few female characters that do appear (Galadriel, Éowyn), similarly to the historical ones, as powerful and key actors in the story. </p>

<p>Tolkien also transformed the historical sources themselves. Similarly to William Morris and Wagner before him, he was as well inspired by the <em>Völsunga saga</em>, and the <em>Nibelungenlied</em>. Morris specifically was a literary inspiration for Tolkien, both in his retelling of the <em>Völsunga</em>, and his fictional world of the <em>The Well at the World's End</em>. <sup><a href="#fn26-17234" id="fnr26-17234" title="see footnote" class="footnote">26</a></sup></p>

<p>Wagner's opera <em>The Ring of the Nibelung</em> must have definitely influenced Tolkien's placement of the magic Ring as central in the plot. However, Tolkien sought to undo the damage done by Wagner’s repugnant ideology, and his usurpation of the <em>Völsunga</em> tales. This can be seen in how the power of the Ring is presented. Wagner's tale idealised the pursuit of power for its own sake. Tolkien on the other hand, updated the ring quest into the twentieth century, by turning it on its head—instead of the Ring being the ultimate prize of a mighty hero, the destruction of its corruptive power becomes the goal. This transformation can be further seen in the &quot;anti-hero&quot; of the Ring quest, Frodo. While noblemen and kings became corrupted by the Ring's power, the weak and merciful Frodo carries it to its doom.<sup><a href="#fn27-17234" id="fnr27-17234" title="see footnote" class="footnote">27</a></sup></p>

<figcaption>1965 paperback editions of <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>, with cover illustrations by Barbara Remington.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Tolkien's influence can be seen far and wide in fantasy. He even influenced the use of English itself, as nowadays we almost exclusively use the form <em>dwarves</em>, as the plural for <em>dwarf</em>. Before the publication of <em>The Hobbit</em>, the common used form was <em>dwarfs</em>. Going beyond linguistics, I would consider most of fantasy that came later to be somewhat derivate of Tolkien's work. Apart from a few authors (Ursula K. Le Guin comes to mind), fantasy creators had to always somehow position themselves in regards to his work. </p>

<p>Apart from literature, Tolkien also had a big influence on emerging new mediums, where readers would have a much more active role in both world building and storytelling. </p>

<h3>Rise of the Nerds</h3>

<figure>

<figcaption>Advertisement for <em>Dungeons and Dragons</em> from 1981.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Tolkien's unlikely heroes and anti-war themes, which were also read as anti-nuclear, gained him a following among students in the 1960s, mainly in American campuses. While other fantasy authors followed in his footsteps, a separate interest grew in collective storytelling.</p>

<p>Heavily inspired by Tolkien’s world, <em>Dungeons and Dragons</em>, first board game, and then tabletop roleplaying game, has been released in 1974. The books outlined a fictional fantasy world, its lore and creatures, spells and character classes. The games had a fantasy setting imposed onto them, but they encouraged storytelling for players, and creating their own personal characters. </p>

<p>“Herds of nerds” loved the game, but with its popularity concerns of parents rose. It was called “the most effective introduction to the occult in the history of man”. The fact that teenagers were fantasising about magic and swords sparked controversy in the USA, especially among Christian groups, such as B.A.D.D. (Bothered About Dungeons and Dragons). <sup><a href="#fn28-17234" id="fnr28-17234" title="see footnote" class="footnote">28</a></sup></p>

<p>Recognising that my personal experience with &quot;paper&quot; roleplaying games has been sporadic at best, I thought that it would be best to have a talk with someone with better experience on the topic. I've thought about my friend Héloïse d'Almeida, a French graphic designer, who I remembered being so dedicated to <em>Dungeons and Dragons</em>, that she was playing it with her friends through Skype (before it was the common way). While in Burgundy for the lockdown, she was kind enough to answer a few questions.</p>

<p>As Heloise puts it, the world setting of Dungeons and Dragons is &quot;European Middle Ages, as seen as Americans, that weren't there&quot;, where a millennia worth's of history has been playfully mixed into a single entity, with Dragons thrown on top. Seems about right. </p>

<figure>
<img src="IMAGES/MOVIES/dungeons.jpg" alt="A game of Dungeons and Dragons in the TV show Community (2011)." />
<figcaption>A game of <em>Dungeons and Dragons</em> in the TV show <em>Community</em> (2011).</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The interesting thing is that she has no teenage nostalgia towards RPGs—when I first met her a year and a half ago, she has been playing for only two months. She first got into it by accident, by looking for videos on YouTube that she could listen to while working, and the 4 hour-long podcasts of D&amp;D play sessions were perfect, as they didn't require constant concentration. After that initial interest, Heloise and her sisters found a group of players in their neighbourhood in Paris, that were meeting every week for sessions.</p>

<p>A big difference, in comparison to European history, that Héloïse points out is the way language is used: as all items, spells, weapons, etc. have to be clearly understandable in the game, Latin is substituted for very simple and descriptive names. For example, a potion that increases the strength of your character would be called &quot;Potion Of Giant Strength&quot;, as Giants are obviously very strong.</p>

<p>Something that helps in keeping the link to Medieval history, is the game's strong reliance on the book medium. Here, the book serves two purposes: as the rules grew more and more complex over time, it was the only possible way to collect all this information, pre-Internet era. But, with their suggestive illustrations and skeuomorphic graphics, the game manuals also sparked imagination, and made the player feel like they were shuffling through the manuscripts of old. While most of the game resources are now available online, which is great for accessibility, Heloise admits that it doesn't carry the same emotional load, and she still shares a set of books between her friends. Which she does as the books are expensive to buy, but it also reinforces the link between the playing group. And, its a refreshing thing to care for something so deeply with your friends, as a counter to the throw-away culture.</p>

<p>One set of books makes sense within roles that the players assume: one takes on the role of the Game (or Dungeon) Master, and others the roles of Player Characters. The Player Character is a single entity, that the player tries to role-play as, trying to imagine its personality, goals and decisions. As the games are mostly spoken, except for dice rolls and maps, the Dungeon Master takes care of the rest of the story: the narration, the world setting, the non-playable characters. </p>

<p>For Héloïse, all of the complex and detailed combat rules, which can even detail up to a single inch what your character is doing, should only serve as a backdrop for the Game Master to create funny and interesting situations, an hour-long elaborate joke for the players to share, shared memories of things that didn't really happen. </p>

<p>In the aspect of character role-play, Héloïse found that she prefers to play as characters which share some personality traits with her own – for example having a chaotic moral alignment, which often allows her to look for ways to bend the rules, which she says is similar to how she acts herself. On the other hand, playing as a lawful character proves to be too slow and confusing. (The rules of Dungeon and Dragons give the player a now well-known chart of 9 moral alignments to choose from, with Good, Neutral, Evil on one axis, and Lawful, Neutral and Chaotic on the other. Two neutrals result in the True Neutral alignment). </p>

</figure>

<p>Being on the other side of the Game Master screen, not only requires a great deal of preparation in the story and attention in keeping track of players actions, but can also be very unpredictable. Heloise clued me in how a Game Master can subtly direct the players by giving an illusion of choice, or leaving multiple clues towards one direction. On the other hand, the unpredictability is what sets the game apart – she mentioned a great moment, when, after being used more linear storylines, one realises what they can do with their characters is theoretically endless. </p>

<h2>Letters and signifiers</h2>

<p>After being in kindergarten, when Pokémon ruled, I didn’t have many common interest with other kids when growing up. Not having much athletic talent, I also wasn’t very interested in football. That, combined with growing up in a non-Christian household meant missing out from the most common topics that kids were talking about, football and first communion. I found refuge in books and music. First discovering (classic) heavy metal music through my brother, and then fantasy books, and fantasy video games, made me feel like it was something of my own to be interested in. Being 10, and living in the outskirts of Warsaw, meant that life was simple and there wasn’t much to rebel against, there wasn’t much of a bad crowd to get mixed up with. </p>

<p>The cursed words—graphic design—would take years to appear before me, but back then I was already attracted to its story-telling qualities, as well as a way for expressing yourself. Wearing a black t-shirt of Black Sabbath's <em>MASTER OF REALITY</em> cover art, which was nothing but huge purple letters, or of <em>SABBATH BLODDY SABBATH</em>, with its hellish and sexually suggestive cover, not to mention the huge scull with &quot;666&quot; above it, was about the most rebellious thing I could do. Or so it seems in retrospect, back then what mattered most was that the music and the expressive letterings were as cool as they could be, and that was a base for finding my own self. </p>

<figure>
<img src="IMAGES/MUSIC/sabbathbloddy.jpg" alt="" />
</figure>

<p>Letters, letters, letters. With so little, with such minimal gestures, they can tell so much. Letters are similar to the ancient tales of myths. We know, more or less, their forms, and can anticipate how they start, and how they finish, what is their moral. Each culture (that uses Latin alphabet) has their own version, while having a shared backbone. They also seem to have origins too far away for us to grasp. </p>

<figure>
<img src="IMAGES/_HISTORICAL%20IMAGES/Durer_letters.png" alt="‌Four Books on Measurement by Albrecht Dürer (1525)." />
<figcaption><em>‌Four Books on Measurement</em> by Albrecht Dürer (1525).</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>While letters seem to have been created already a some time ago (especially in the case of Roman capitals of the Trajan Column),
they are in a state of constant transformation. Currently, it might be perhaps the most intense in recent history, during the last 30 years, thanks to the availability of the personal computer. While there might exist a hazy “standard” form of the letter that we are striving to achieve, like spoken tales, each one of us can insert their own interpretations, both from the side of the reader and the writer (of the letter). Generally, the overarching trends and models of typefaces have changed, like languages, organically over long periods of time. But unlike language, the letters, which are carriers of language, were conjured by a few people at most, if not a single person. </p>

<p>A type designer that's well aware of these poetical qualities of letters, is Jules Durand (a.k.a LazyDog)<sup><a href="#fn29-17234" id="fnr29-17234" title="see footnote" class="footnote">29</a></sup>. In his masters video/type designer manifesto called <em>a Tale of Type</em>, he presents his &quot;family tree&quot; of meticulously drawn typefaces. Jules moves freely across historical models of letters, Arts &amp; Crafts revivals, and modern video games references. He calls his typefaces &quot;Typographic Revivance&quot; as opposed to Typographic Revivals: having a clear starting point in a historical typeface, but transforming them further to his own vision. </p>

<p>Technically, his typefaces are not different from, let's say, a contemporary neo-grotesque (Helvetica-like). They are drawn using the same computer software, approximated with the same logic of Bezier curves, and they are stored under the same .ttf/.otf file formats. However, they do <em>feel</em> different. </p>

<figcaption>A Tale of Type</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>On the form level, Durand employs a much bigger level of intricacy in the shapes. As he himself puts it, the qualities he looks for in typefaces are: &quot;ornamentation, exuberance &amp; refinement&quot;<sup><a href="#fn30-17234" id="fnr30-17234" title="see footnote" class="footnote">30</a></sup>. On the level of presentation, by talking about typographical alchemy, showing interfaces of fantasy video games and magical 3D renders, he creates a deeper context for his letters. By tapping into the collective imagination on these morphologies, he creates an atmosphere of deeper history. Despite showing all his cards, the power of suggestion of the letter shapes and the visuals the combines them with upkeeps the suspension of disbelief. </p>

<p>Roland Barthes in his collection of essays <em>Mythologies</em> describes the way that fringes of Ancient Rome are used as <em>signs</em> in Joseph Mankiewicz's movie <em>Julius Caesar</em>. Throughout the film, actors bear a &quot;little flag displayed on their foreheads&quot;, keeping up at all times the historical plausibility. </p>

<p>In media dealing with the medieval and the medieval fantasy, we can observe a lot of such similar signs: horses, knights equipment, castles, etc. If enough of them are present, the suspension of disbelief is kept up, the magic happens. </p>

<p>Few were more aware of these signifiers than the British comedy group Monty Python. In their film <em>Monty Python and the Holy Grail</em> they break the 4th wall in almost every scene, constantly exposing and mocking the art of cinema. In many cases, they have turned their film budget limitations into jokes – the most famous one being the usage of coconuts, in lieu of horse riding. Their play with theatrics of cinema, and the humorous awareness of the medium is incredible. As usual with Python productions, most of the characters that have dialogue are portrayed by one of the five members of the six-person group (sans Terry Gilliam). It's not uncommon for the same actor to play two different roles during a scene. Right from the start, they subvert the accuracy of the historical setting – the coconuts become a starting point of a discussion about air-speed velocity of African swallows. Later on, King Arthur comes across a pair of subjects, which look the part of medieval, plague disfigured peasant, but they question his kingly authority as a dictatorship, &quot;a self-perpetuating autocracy&quot; and claim to be living in a anarcho-syndicalist commune. About one-third into the movie, a &quot;famous historian&quot; shooting a documentary, but at the same time narrating the plot so far, is killed by one of the knights. This in turn leads to the anti-climax ending, where King Arthur is arrested by the British Police. </p>

<p>How is the illusion kept? How despite all of this, despite the actors literally prancing about with their hands up in the air holding invisible reins, was I still 100% sure that I was watching a part of an Arthurian legend? The power of suggestion is so strong, that after each joke that breaks the illusion, within 10 seconds back in the action, the tale continued.</p>

<p>After the opening credits roll by, the film starts. The triumphant trumpets and harps reminiscent of court musicians announce the coming adventure. The Lombardic-like letters set the time and place: England, 932 A.D. Then, fog, a skeleton tied to a wooden pole, and a sound of horse's hooves (or so we think). Before subverting the cliches, they create such a fool-proof setting, they can always fall back into it, no matter how far they stray from it.</p>

</figure>

<p>Relying on such cliches and assumptions can also lead to very questionable results. In the 1981 animated movie <em>Heavy Metal</em>, based on stories from a legendary magazine of the same title, the characters are so unbelievably cliched, it becomes both hilarious and uncomfortable to watch today. The trope of the damsel in distress is very bluntly expressed visually – all of the female characters through out the movie, of course helpless and passive, have large breasts and are constantly sexually aroused. During the last, iconic segment, a female warrior Taarna takes the spotlight. We can immediately tell that she has a hero status, not only because of her wielding a sword and riding a giant bird, but also because of her considerably smaller cleavage.</p>

<h1>Part 3: The Abstraction</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>“We might conclude that, if the human experiment was aimed at the expanding the sphere of rationality and reducing chaos, the human experiment is over. The very tools that enabled the expansion of rationality and human control (science, technology, industry, and information) have subsumed life to abstraction. And living warmth can only be found outside the icy walls of the citadel of reason.” F. Bernardi <sup><a href="#fn31-17234" id="fnr31-17234" title="see footnote" class="footnote">31</a></sup></p>

<h2>The Meme Apocalypse</h2>
</blockquote>

<figure>

</figure>

<p>How are the afterimages seen while sailing the uncharted waters of the Internet of things? </p>

<p>It seems to me that we find ourselves beyond the stage of Monty Python's subverting and playing with established cliches. The associations about Middle Ages are still there, but the excess of information overloads the meaning – the historical imagery is remixed into a memetic purgatory. Taken out of context, remixed and reappropriated. </p>

<figure>
<img src="IMAGES/MEMES/IMG_7054.PNG" alt="" />
</figure>

<p>Here, the absurd and repetition create a myth. When previously, the afterimages were used to create harmony, to fabricate a deeper backstory, now they are used for creating tension and unease.</p>

<figure>
<img src="IMAGES/MEMES/IMG_7142.JPG" alt="" />
</figure>

<h2>Algorithmic Storytelling</h2>

<p>In case of modern example of the afterimage, we can observe a multi-layer cake of nostalgia, starting from history, through fantasy literature and early role-playing games. </p>

<p>Because <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> and subsequent fantasy games started gaining popularity in the USA and then rest of the world in the 1980s, they were a perfect inspiration for the developing market of video games, mainly home console and computer games. Whereas ‘classical’ paper and pen roleplaying games required free-form, abstract thinking from its players, the computer ones focused more on structure and logic.</p>

<figure>
<img src="IMAGES/GAMES/final%20fantasy.jpg" alt="Poster found in the video game magazine Nintendo Power, advertising the release of Final Fantasy (1987)." />
<figcaption>Poster found in the video game magazine <em>Nintendo Power</em>, advertising the release of <em>Final Fantasy</em> (1987).</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Today, those early computer games are referenced in another layer of nostalgia, in based on algorithmic structures and machine-learning.</p>

<p><em>Dwarf Fortress</em>, one of such examples, is a dungeon-manager simulator at its core.<sup><a href="#fn32-17234" id="fnr32-17234" title="see footnote" class="footnote">32</a></sup> By default, the game is made purely of ASCII characters, so until a player uploads a graphical texture package, most that you see are letters and symbols of different colours (a perfect game for a typographer?). So, visually, not only is your imagination directed to something older because of the medieval setting, but also because of the 1980s aesthetics. A double afterimage. </p>

<p>The familiarity also helps to create a sense of immersion much quicker, despite the archaic interface. This is brought further before the game proper starts. Before you gather your team of trusty dwarves, you go through the process of world building. Simulation runs, every time randomly generating geography, history, etc. through the passage of time. From the created world, you only occupy a small chunk of it. What took Tolkien his whole creative life, here can be generated in just a few seconds. </p>

<figure>
<img src="IMAGES/GAMES/dwarf-fortress-the-helmedstabs-chronicles_prka.jpg" alt="ASCII interface of Dwarf Fortress" />
<figcaption>ASCII interface of <em>Dwarf Fortress</em></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Another example that I found is the web browser game <em>AI Dungeon</em>.<sup><a href="#fn33-17234" id="fnr33-17234" title="see footnote" class="footnote">33</a></sup> Here, the user interface is very minimal, in principle it is a text based game, reminiscent of the old text adventure games, created at American universities in the 1970s, often as a showcase of the possible computing power of new machines.</p>

<p>As you might have deducted from the name, there is a crucial difference in how the text read by the player is generated. In the older games, the programmers had to write all the possible situations that the player might encounter. Also, a very specific list of actions that the player can choose from was crucial – there could be no misunderstandings, for the story to go forward.</p>

<p>In the case of the <em>AI Dungeon</em>, there is no preset stories, and no pre-determined actions that you have to choose from. You do have to choose from a few possible world settings (such as Fantasy, Cyberpunk, Apocalyptic, etc.) and then a character within that setting. In the case of Fantasy—you can choose from the usual suspects: a Knight, a Wizard, a Princess, etc. Then, the AI is your Game Master, introducing you to the story and the world in a few sentences. Then, you can freely type what your character might do, say, or you might even fill some of the story by yourself.</p>

<p>As impressive as it is coding-wise, in the end you could say that the &quot;game&quot; is simply a glorified, extremly elaborate chatbot. But, as in many previous examples, the historical afterimages act as a key into your imagination, to help you submerge in the fantasy. </p>

<p>The difference is that in both games, the element of a personal interaction is taken out, as you are not reading deep thoughts of a book author, or you are not collectively dreaming with other nerds sitting next to you. Or that's how it might seem, as in the end the algorithms in question did not fall out the sky, they were also written by human beings. Why then, does it feel differently for me? It might be the removal of a tactile objects (no books, no dice, etc.), or it might be simply my bias of knowing that I am looking at something automatically generated, and not that was considerably made.</p>

<h2>Afterimages in art</h2>

<p>I have commented on a lot of visual material, many of which could be considered different forms of &quot;graphic design&quot;. But what about visual art itself? How can those afterimages be used?</p>

<p>Wanting to be less broad and more specific, I've reached out to a friend of mine – Laura Nicholson<sup><a href="#fn34-17234" id="fnr34-17234" title="see footnote" class="footnote">34</a></sup>, an artist based in London. They live and breathe art theory, which proved to be helpful in legitimising my arguments, after our talk. Also what also came to my mind are the fantasy motifs that they use in their insanely detailed and satisfying to watch works. </p>

<figure>
<img src="IMAGES/FANTASY%20ARTISTS/NICHOLSON_LAURA/Screenshot%202020-12-02%20at%2010.17.58.png" alt="A linocut by Laura" />
<figcaption>A linocut by Laura</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Knowing that Laura came from the USA and then studied in England, I thought it would be a good opportunity to check how much of my assumptions in this text could be only limited to Northern Europe. What I didn't expect is that as a kid, Laura was going to &quot;really, really rural Ireland&quot; every summer, where they could see things that predate written history, and that European Christian mythology rests on something pagan, something &quot;other&quot;.</p>

<p>Literary classic like the King Arthur tales were also present, and the Brother Grimm tales were the first thing that their mother read to them – which later made Disney movies shocking, as no one had their feet cut off, and there was no blood.</p>

<p>For Laura, these tales harked back to something more solid than what they could find in the America, because of America being &quot;deeply ahistorical&quot;. However, Europeanness was not something in and of itself, but a value that came from it being non-American.
Coming back to America and declaring &quot;I JUST CAME FROM EUROPE&quot; was an identity within the American one. Laura's interest in Europe's history wasn't so much because it was European, but because it was older. As Native American history has been annihilated, the only way to get a sense of things happening over time, is to go to Europe. Europe is where history happens for America. </p>

<p>The idea of Europe also allowed for reflection on the harshness of the American capitalism, it was the dangerous and kinky place where communism might be possible. (Laura admits that one of their first drawings were big titted women with huge communist symbols, as it was something exotic.) </p>

<figure>
<img src="IMAGES/FANTASY%20ARTISTS/NICHOLSON_LAURA/Screenshot%202020-12-02%20at%2010.17.36.png" alt="A linocut by Laura" />
<figcaption>A linocut by Laura</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>When asked about the fantasy themes in their art, Laura acknowledges that part of it is personal, and part of it is just what they enjoy drawing, and a rational for it might not have been found until years after it had been drawn.</p>

<p>Laura works a lot around the idea that you will project yourself, or easily find yourself in connection to the human body. They always try to work with images that people can find themselves in relation to, and then play with those images. For example, Laura likes to combine porn with surgery videos, with popular culture coming into a mix that is hopefully nausea inducing. And it has to be recognisable for it to be nausea inducing, to feel strange. If something is too strange, then it's just strange. Technique-wise, a lot of works are informed by the combination of comic books and traditional painting.</p>

<figcaption>A linocut by Laura</figcaption>

<p>When I pointed out how precise Laura was in describing this, in contrast to the vague question I have asked, I got back a quote to remember: &quot;I have to have a lot of precision, because I am a mess.&quot; </p>

<h1>Part 4: The Departure</h1>

<h2>Farewell, or only a Greeting</h2>

<p>Initially when I was going into this topic, I was simply following my instinct for interesting images, and I was mainly aiming to treat this text as a chronicle for the time I was writing it in, and the research I have done. </p>

<p>However, I was happy to discover that by spending some time learning about Middle Ages, I was be able to gain a better understanding of the period, and how it has far-reaching effects on so many areas of, well, everything. It felt refreshing to be able to break through the surface of shallow Internet research, going into archives, touching history, looking for it everywhere, around the streets, under my bed. By doing that, and most importantly, discussing fantasy with others, the story started to emerge. I saw that when seen in the &quot;real&quot; world, the Medieval afterimages serve as a reminder of history. A reminder that is often used to legitimise the one who is reminding, be it the legislative power of a city hall, or the production qualities of a beer company.</p>

<p>But, in the case of fiction, the function of those afterimages is different. In hundred-year-old fantasy literature, or in Minecraft—here the afterimages are used as an anchor of sorts. An anchor that through shared imagination of history, gives us a base of understanding, from which the author can deviate from. Furthermore, the historical origin of those afterimages acts as a key that evokes dreaming on the reader. But, dreaming in a different sense than dreaming of desires for a better future, be it a better future for you, or the world. Instead, it unlocks dreaming through the past, that breaks that anticipation of what's to come. It helps to dream of a time and space separate from ours.</p>

<figcaption>&quot;Lothlorien&quot; by Greg and Tim Hildebrandt</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>My final conclusions are not groundbreaking. But, by going through that path, I am able to stand behind them more firmly, and be more aware of afterimages of the Medieval, and also other, periods. For better or worse, there is no escaping history. So it seems to me, to be able to understand where we are today, visually, to see the snowball getting bigger and bigger, the best way to start would be to understand the past.</p>

<p>I can only hope that you, on the other side of the screen, has left this text somewhat more informed, or at least entertained. </p>
