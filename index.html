<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>In this text I am investigating the presence of visual themes in contemporary culture that relate to the medieval period in history. </p>

<p>I try to examine some of the source material from the period, and its connection to what we consider the fantasy genre. I also attempt to find out why is there such a high degree of Euro-centric visuals in modern fantasy, as well as what kind of emotions they aim to evoke.</p>

<h3>The Afterimage</h3>

<p>Take a good look at an image, best if it’s a very specific shape, on a contrasting background. If you stare at the centre of it for about 30 seconds, trying to relax your eyes and look “beyond” it, and then look at a blank wall, you’re still going to see it floating in front of your eyes. While you can still make out the general shape of it, the form is already getting blurry. The colours are inverted into a weird cyan-green that doesn’t seem to exist in nature. After a few seconds the image now completely dissipates.</p>

</figure>

<p>I am interested in where and in what way can we see such “afterimages” of the European Middle Ages in today’s culture, mainly focusing on fantastical, magical themes and the iconography of knights, kings, castles and damsels in distress. Despite the overwhelming pace of change in modes of living, and increased presence of technology in our everyday lives, we can find those archetypes in some of the most popular contemporary books, movies and TV shows. </p>

<p>The fantasy genre is also directly connected to the rise of narrative driven video games, as both crept into the mainstream from the basements of nerd culture of the 1980s and 90s. Today, fantasy video games promise free-roaming adventures in lush, virtual worlds. Next to science fiction and superheroes stories, fantasy can be considered one of the pillars of mass-consumed fictional media.</p>

<p>Where does this phenomenon come from? Is it a reaction to a world where everything is known through science, and there’s little room for magic? Or is it an attraction towards storytelling structures that are so distant from our everyday lives? And why does fantasy rely so much on euro-centric themes? </p>

<p>More than 500 years later, what are the afterimages of medieval times that still ring out in our societies? And how did the way visual culture was consumed changed since then? </p>

<h1>PART 1: The History</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>When we speak of ‘history’, when we view events from a historical perspective, we are imposing a certain modulation of our perception and projection of time. Historical perception shapes time into an all-encompassing dimension that forces individuals and groups to share their temporalities according to a uniform meter and a teleological (or economic) frame. People enter the historical domain when they all hear more or less the same music in their ears.—F. Bernardi <sup><a href="#fn2-22961" id="fnr2-22961" title="see footnote" class="footnote">2</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Middle Point</h3>

<p>The period that falls roughly between the years 300 and 1500 AD, stuck between the apparent wonders of the ancient world of Greece and Rome and the classical rationale reborn in the European renaissance, is stereotyped as a period of stagnation and misery. It’s in the name itself – the “Dark” Ages, or the ”medieval”, from the Latin <em>medium aevum</em>, a “Middle Age”. While a “Dark Age” describes the period quite clearly in a negative light, the “Middle” goes even further—it suggests that it is a moment only defined by notable things that happened before, and came afterwards.</p>

<p>In his book Medieval Bodies, art historian Jack Hartnell, who by his own definition deals with revealing the realities of the Middle Ages from this warped impression, brings up a public survey done by a major London museum. The visitors were asked to imagine themselves living in the medieval and renaissance periods, and describe what they might have felt or seen. As expected, people responded positively to the renaissance: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I’m in Florence walking by the river at midday. It’s peaceful, I’m smiling. I’m an artist’s model and he’s sculpting the Madonna and Child. The sunshine sparkles, there’s a little glade and a little lake. There’s philosophy, people sitting round talking about politics, books. Music … I want to stay and dream.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In a stark contrast, ideas about the Middle Ages were rather bleak:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are soldiers, peasants, high castles, muddy lowlands … Black Death and Plague are all around. It’s raining. People are drunk on mead and fighting among themselves. The artists are not respected. I’m in a dungeon wearing a potato sack and it’s night. It’s cold, there are rats. The windows have bars at floor level. I stole some potatoes for your newborn child.” <sup><a href="#fn3-22961" id="fnr3-22961" title="see footnote" class="footnote">3</a></sup> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here we can see how stereotypes of historical periods are disconnected from the reality of place (we are always in Florence), the elements (it’s always raining), and history itself (potatoes came to Europe only from America in 1570).</p>

<p>Understanding Middle Ages is the problem not only of the time, in terms of agreeing on specific time boundaries, but also of space—while a lot of imagination about the time is (western)Euro-centric, Hartnell argues that it should be rather seen as a period of intense interaction (positive and negative), between the inheritors of legacy of the Roman Empire: the emerging European states, the Byzantine Empire, and the Islamic World.</p>

<p>Maps of the world reflected this – showing the structure of the world as a connection of Africa, Asia and Europe, with Jerusalem (or sometimes Constantinople), as the <em>axis mundi</em>, or the central axis. </p>

<figcaption><em>Die ganze Welt in einem Kleberblat</em> (The entire World in a Cloverleaf), a map from 1581, an interesting example of a transitional period between Middle Ages and Modernity (note America is shown and labelled by its name</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>While the viewpoint on the period was maintained by the rational reformers that came later in history, it might have its origins in the Late Medieval period. The Italian author Francesco Petrarch wrote: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>“There was a more fortunate age and probably there will be one again; in the middle, in our time, you see the confluence of wretches and ignominy… My fate is to live among varied and confusing storms. But for you perhaps, if, as I hope and wish, you will live long after me, there will follow a better age. When the darkness has been dispersed, our descendants can come again into the former pure radiance.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Seeing how much his sentiment resonates with me in connection to our time, I do wonder if some comparisons could be drawn between ours and Petrarch’s times. Or, as he was a great scholar of Cicero, perhaps it is a common feeling when confronted with history of periods that have passed.
<mark>rewrite those quotes</mark></p>

<h3>Theory of Seeing</h3>

<p>Personally, I have been drawn to the Medieval period because of the apparent contrasts and contradictions: it’s “middle” infamy, despite being a quite clear beginning of the way modern European states are shaped, it’s apparent “darkness” and strangeness. I think that this dualism is best seen from art of the period. </p>

<p>On one hand, we can observe rich and detailed manuscripts, rich tapestries, gold decorated churches. On the other, one can’t help but laugh at the crude and symbolic compositions with an almost non existent perspective, especially baffling when keeping in mind the preceding hellenistic paintings and the succeeding renaissance ones.</p>

<figure>
<img src="IMAGES/_HISTORICAL%20IMAGES/ulrich-frauendienst-450x635.jpg" alt="" />
</figure>

<p>Because I’m focusing so much on the period, I would like to start at the beginning, that is, in the middle, and briefly look at the source material of art from the period, with the help of experts. </p>

<p>Today we usually see afterimages as mere optical illusion, or at best tricks to create eye hurting visuals. But Władysław Strzemiński, a prominent polish artist of the 1920s avant garde, saw the phenomenon as a important piece of the puzzle in his Theory of Seeing, as saw it as a reason for such strong links between pottery, architecture and sculpture in ancient cultures.</p>

<p>Because of his engineering background, and because of WWI injuries that damaged his eyesight, he began to be more and more interested in visual phenomena, in relation to history of art. Before WWII, while teaching art history at a university in Cracow, he started to develop his own approach to the curriculum—not a typical history of painting. Strzemiński was well aware of the close connection of visual awareness with culture, education, civilisation and technology.</p>

<p>The titular theory was as such: since ancient civilisations formed, our actual eyesight, in a biological sense, has not evolved. Yet, we can observe a growing awareness in how we use our eyesight through history: starting with contour vision
of the paleolit, through silhouette vision, through the perspective leaps of the renaissance. He accentuates that our notions of realism in art changed, and that the process of growing awareness is a reflection of historical progress.</p>

<p>Interestingly enough, he claims that such awareness makes the biggest leaps during periods of ‘high’ historical activity, and stagnates during periods of stability. In combination with the times that Strzemiński was writing in, including also his ideas about the class struggle, he points out the mechanisms of manipulating society with art subordinated to authority, which has grave consequences, as according to him, the regression of art equals the regression of the whole societal system.</p>

<p>When describing the Middle Ages, at first he points out the apparent—the seeming ‘fall’ of civilisation with the decline of the Roman-Greek culture was reflected in the arts and a continuity of progression has been broken in the Early Middle Ages, and there has been a regression in visual awareness, in comparison to late hellenic art, which might seem to us now as ‘realistic’: using three-dimensional perspective, and subtly complex colors to show material qualities of merchandise. However, the apparent regression has not been equal across the territory of the fallen Roman Empire.</p>

<p>In the Byzantine, art went back to flat background and what Strzemiński describes as the ‘architectoniation’ of art: a usage of architectural forms in painting and sculpture, using clearly defined lines to show the boundaries of an object, and to build up the whole composition of an image.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in Northern and Central Europe, Romanesque art stayed under a big influence of the Byzantine, but in some areas regressed to primitive silhouette art, or even at times line art, which corresponds with the art of early Ancient Egypt, with around 4000 years of difference in between. <strong>2</strong> </p>

<p>Staying on the level of a formal analysis (ie. one that analyses only the elements of the form), it can be said that both art of Middle Ages and Ancient Egypt uses “intentional perspective”, where scale of dimensions represents the importance of an individual in the social hierarchy. But to explain why the societies of Early Middle Ages used that perspective, Strzemiński goes away from formal analysis and back to his definition of visual awareness: as a reflection of reality of a given point in time, that a given society reached at that point. And the formal elements are used to express that awareness. </p>

<p>As history is not a direct repetition of what once was, but certain similarities can be seen. In case of Medieval art, Strzemiński argues that the reason for the use of intentional perspective is the priesthood rule and feudal system in most of Europe. Proof of this can be seen both in the many cases of using the intentional perspective, as well as the usage of Christian themes.</p>

<p>Another thing than couldn’t be explained purely by a formal analysis, is how as similar type of painting and similar type of perspective could be well used in both Western European Romaneqsue architecture, an in Eastern European Byzantine one. For Strzemiński, the common link is the architectonisation. </p>

<p>In both Romanesque groin vaults and Byzantine arches, the main compositional element was the square—which can be observed in painting as the grid for dimensions and proportions.</p>

<p>Strzemiński goes so far as to connect the process of architectonisation of art directly to the phenomenon of the afterimage, as architectural forms which linger in our retinas after being observed, are then found again in paintings. This harmony is perceived by us as beauty. [expand on this]</p>

<p>In ancient Greece, the architectonisation process was done in connection to column architecture. The architectural elements that were distilled from this, only reinforced linearity. </p>

<p>Because in the Middle Ages the element that architectonisied were the three-dimensional vaults, the process of transformation into three-dimensional visual awareness could happen much faster. </p>

<p>Another reason for the much faster development of visual awareness in the Middle Ages was the fact that Middle Ages were not an era of creating culture out of nowhere, but an era of reconstructing culture within a new societal structure, and progress went faster than in antiquity. Influences came from more advanced cultures of the time (Byzantium and Islam), as well as monuments of roman art.</p>

<p>Despite similarities in the hegemony of priesthood, a big difference in the societal structure of middle ages in comparison to antiquity, is the feudal system. Instead of slaves, a passive commodity, peasant serfs which were much more involved within societies, became the main element of the low class. This can explain the rapid progression during the period, and leaping through many stages of evolution. It could be said that Middle Ages in Europe were not a dead period in history, but on the contrary—one of the most sudden periods of reorganising the societal structures.

<h3>Echoes within Structure</h3>

<p>As I found out during the research for this text, by starting to dig in history you can almost never stop with going back after the bread crumbs. Still, it has become more and more clear for me how the Middle Age period seems to be the cradle of today’s Europe, the region that has been physically and culturally my home. Understanding that period better has helped to understand the state of affairs today. </p>

<p>It’s influence still echoes today. It was the period that established Christian dominance in the region. While in countries like the Netherlands or Germany its influence (which is still very strong) is a bit more vague, and hidden deep under the layer of secular statehoods, in places like Poland is much more direct—the recent heinous decision of the Supreme Court to tighten the abortion laws being a good example. </p>

<p>I remember very well from history lessons that the real beginning of the history of Poland was its Baptism in 966. Despite being over a 1000 years later, it was still seen as a moment defining the whole country’s identity. Despite being theoretically a secular state, you can observe the crucifix in most state organisations, courts and schools. </p>

<p>I am writing most of this text during my internship period in Berlin. Berlin’s coat of arms is a black bear, a symbol that can be traced back almost 800 years back. Across many European cities we can still observe coats of arms, flags, or different heraldic symbols with many references to Medieval past.

<h3>Living History</h3>

<p>On the 30th of October 2020, the last possible day before it was closed off to non-university users, I managed to reserve a time slot in the library of the Humboldt University in Berlin. It’s an impressive building, funnily enough called the Jacob-und-Wilhelm-Grimm-Zentrum. When I used to study Architecture, I remember staring for hours at the photographs of its grand reading room, accentuated by a square construction grid, with a void space that spans 5 floors. And I finally ended up here, in the strangest circumstances. After a bit of back and forth with the reception, regarding my lack of held cards, I arrived at the 6th floor (above the void-reading room), in the Historical Collections room. Even before going in, I already had a feeling that I shouldn’t be there, that I was trespassing in some secret governmental archive. It was hard to believe that I was let inside, just thanks to a few e-mails, and no money taken from me. Being so used to having to pay for everything, even some of the PDFs that I have read for writing this text, it feels very strange to be able to see such important cultural artefacts, entirely for free.</p>

<p>I had requested to see a copy of the Nurnberg Chronicle, a “compendium of universal history”, a brainchild of Hartmann Schedel, a doctor in Nurnberg. It is one of the most densely illustrated and technically advanced works of early printing. The specific copy that I was able to see has been printed in 1493, merely 50 years after Gutenberg started using movable type for printing. After the necessary clearances and preparations, I was able to look through the book freely, spending as much time that I saw fit.</p>

<p>Seeing the book in front of my eyes, made me notice completely different things than looking at scans on the screen, even the high quality ones. First of all, the size of it makes a big difference—each page is about A3, or even bigger in size. That made me less focused on the spread as a singe image, but instead I started reading it as a collection of elements, often quite well detailed. For example, looking at the scans on the screen I would never have noticed that while the text is set with movable type (you can see repeated letter forms), the lettering in the woodcuts is custom made, and a part of the illustration. </p>

<figure>
<img src="IMAGES/LIBRARY%20PHOTOS/IMG_3191.JPG" alt="" />
</figure>

<p>Each woodcut became a collection of lines, which immediately de-mystified the book for me, instead of some strange, other worldly object, it became something that a human could actually produce. </p>

<p>Not that it made the thing less impressive, or diminished its importance for me. Touching the paper from 600 years ago, even if through the gloves (that is until the lady at the desk looked somewhere else), can be only a spiritual experience.</p>

<p>Having the book in front of me, all to my disposal, in a highly guarded building, wearing white gloves made me think of a coroner about to conduct an autopsy. Or rather, of a scholar of the arcane, about to unravel some awesome secret. There were no websites to summarise and categorise the object, no descriptions to skew my interpretation, no experts to guide my attention. The only “facts” I could rely on was the knowledge I already had, and the empirical observations that I could conduct. </p>

<p>The thing that has been de-mystified the most for me, was the books purpose, or rather the bulk of it’s contents. In the end, after an introduction that describes the creation of the world (which of course is based on the bible, apparently the did not hear about the “rational” renaissance being around the corner), most of the book is actually a description of cities in the Holy Roman Empire, and the noble families that had lived in them.</p>

<p>At the end of the book, I stumbled upon Wrocław, the city in Poland that I was born in. Seeing it in such an old account made me believe that history did, in fact, happen. By holding history in my hands, it stopped being a vague annoyance preached by teachers in schools, but an actual cycle of generations, existing for hundred thousand years before me. </p>

<p>Coming from a country with an eroded sense of continuity, and having lived in many places myself, it becomes even more important to find such a proof of historical legitimacy, as a counter to the liquid modernity.

Feeling a rush of excitement, I wanted to see more artefacts, while still in Berlin. Using the Nurnberg Chronicle as a starting point, I've tried to find out if I could see some original prints of Albrecht Durer. As t</p>

<p>Again, seeing how important it is to see things in the flesh, or in the paper, felt like coming out of a long coma, and re-learning things that I knew well before. It is such a basic thing, it is easy for me to forget. It felt like a glass wall of the screen has been lifted in front of my eyes. A curtain lifted, transforming an image I was seeing as only that, an image, into a collection of exposed elements, ready for me to interpret. </p>

<p>The way I look at things, and the way my focus works, makes me rarely look beyond what I am seeing. I rarely analyse and interpret things on my own. Usually the form of an image is what interests me, not its meaning. </p>

<p>I think it’s interesting to look at Albrecht Durer’s work, and other examples of the early printmaking, because of their existence on the border of the Medieval and the Renaissance periods. I could definitely see a difference in quality of the image-making, when comparing his earliest works I’ve seen (Nurnberg Chronicle) and latest (Melancholia). I would argue that his early works are an example of Medieval themes, using Renaissance technology. Apart from Melancholia, I've seen prints from Durer's <em>Apocalypse</em> – a popular topic at the time, as people believed that we world would end in the year 1500. (The Nurnberg Chronicle has empty pages left at the end, for people to record the last years).</p>

<p>In comparison to my previous viewing, the Durer prints were presented to me as single sheets, in a cardboard passepartout. No one in the building really spoke English, but I somehow managed to communicate well enough with a mix of basic German and English, as I had to receive detailed instructions how to handle the artworks. After signing some paperwork regarding the rights to the pictures I have taken, I was left all by myself with the drawings. Just me and Durer. With the prints sitting on a small wooden easel, it felt like I was visiting an old friend locked away in prison. </p>

<figure>
<img src="IMAGES/DURER%20PHOTOS/IMG_7062.JPG" alt="" />
</figure>

<p>The first one I viewed was Saint Michael Fighting the Dragon, from The Apocalypse. At the beginning, I was simply amazed by the quality of the artwork, and overwhelmed by the fact of seeing the print in front of me, in my hand’s reach. After viewing the rest, I returned to it, to analyse it better. Because of my perverse interests, the first thing to have caught my attention was Durer’s famous monogram, sitting at the bottom. </p>

<figure>
<img src="IMAGES/DURER%20PHOTOS/IMG_7065.JPG" alt="" />
</figure>

<p>Otherwise, the first thing to catch my attention is the spear the Angel uses to strike the dragon, because of its remarkably white and unlined appearance, tearing diagonally through the page.</p>

<p>Despite the print showing such an action-packed scene, about 1/5 of the composition is dedicated to showing the surrounding landscape, which can tell us something about Durer’s environment and the values important to him.</p>

<p>First thing to notice, is most of the landscape is still natural. Apart from that, we see: a city (it’s safe to assume it’s representing Nurnberg, or at least Nurnberg was the model), so: city state as the core element of civilisation. Next to the city, we see two ships on a lake, going to what seems to be another, far-off settlement. So, trade, as a way of communicating and exchanging with the rest of the world. Next, in the city and just outside of it, we see two church towers. Next to the protective city walls, the presence of churches is on of the most visible elements of the man-made landscape.</p>

<p>Despite the scene being biblical, we are able to see the structure of Durer’s world: a network of guarded cities of Nurnberg, Koln, Bern, etc.</p>

<p>The next print I have seen were the <em>‌The Four Horsemen</em>. Admittedly, I wasn't so up to date on my Bible knowledge – I always preferred fantasy that kept up an earnest distance to it being fictional. But, by analysing what we can see in the image, we can see what Durer is trying to communicate. Each of the riders is carrying a different weapon, which is surely not accidental. While just by looking, three of the horsemen could be read as heroic characters – but the fourth one odd, clearly sticking out from the rest in the composition as well as in his menacing look, suggest a sinister side of the group <mark>confront that with later read info</mark></p>

<figure>
<img src="IMAGES/DURER%20PHOTOS/DP816773.jpg" alt="" />
</figure>

<p>The third print I've seen, was <em>‌The Vision of the Seven</em> Candlesticks. Here, Durer again leaves a lot of visual clues. St. Johns kneeling position, clasped hands and bare feet suggest his submission to the almighty God, of course shown as an old, wise man. Everywhere we see the symbolism of number seven, important in the Apocalypse. Apart from his place in the composition, and an authoritative seated position, it is worth noting what are the visible symbols of God's power: eyes surrounded by fire, 7 stars surrounding his right hand, a sword sticking out of his mouth and a book in the left hand.

<h3>Fantasy Tales</h3>

<p>Despite the turmoil filled association to the historical period of middle ages that most of us might have, it seems that elements, themes and icons relating to the period are still strongly present in children’s tales, books, movies, as well as state and city emblems. However, the medieval influence has been reduced to icons and associations, according to the times they were used. </p>

<p>Asking friends and colleagues, also the ones that were brought up in USA, Brazil or Korea, there seems to be some kind of shared imagination of fantasy tales, and visually it seems to be always referencing some parts of the European iconography.</p>

<p>As with Middle Ages, it’s hard to define specific dates when fantasy as a literary genre emerged, especially considering the long and ancient history of tales, filled with supernatural themes, and the vague distinction between what we would consider ‘religion’ and ‘fiction’.</p>

<p>However, in relation to Middle Ages, it could be said that the Romantic period of the XIX century introduced a certain kind of nostalgia towards the supernatural as a counteraction to the rational thinking of the Enlightenment, but carrying with Enlightenment’s perception of the Middle Ages as the time period when imagination and the irrational ruled. </p>

<p>A lot of the literature was aimed at children—Brothers Grimm wrote down and reintroduced a lot of common folk tales, some of which have clear references to medievality, such as Snow White, the Sleeping Beauty, or Rapunzel.
Another important example is the The Well at the World's End by author, artist and independent printer William Morris. Morris heavily admired the Middle Ages, and reflected that inspiration in the archaic language that referenced the old tales of romance. Being dissatisfied with the low-quality production values of books of his time, and as a counter-reaction to the industrial revolution, the editions printed by him were richly decorated, and he incorporated the manuscript-like golden ration for the page layout. The book is also important, as it is considered one of the first ones to not only talk about fantastical themes, but actually describe a fantastical world different from our own.</p>

<figure>
<img src="IMAGES/LITERATURE/The_wood_beyond_the_world_by_William_Morris.jpg" alt="" />
</figure>

<p>After various of those ‘pre-fantasy’ books, fantasy is widely considered to have started with the emergence of pulp magazines in the 1920s, in the USA.
After the II World War, longer literary forms emerged, with Lord of The Rings proving the most popular. While the history of the fantasy genre consists of a number of different actors, and there isn’t a single point of creation, the legacy of J. R. R. Tolkien’s work cannot be overlooked. What set him apart from other (medieval) fantasy writers of his time was the extent of the world building that he accomplished. Tolkien himself drew inspiration from all aspects of his life: from personal experiences, to his great knowledge about European mythos. </p>

<p>While he combined tales and elements from many different European cultures, the one source that stands out are the legends surrounding the catastrophic annihilation of an early Germanic people, know as the Burgundians, in 436 by the Huns, acting as mercenary agents of the Roman Emperor. </p>

<p>The heroic age for the Teutonic people were the chaotic fifth and sixth centuries, when the Roman Empire was slowly collapsing before the Northern barbarian tribes. The events rose to legends by oral tradition, and were written down first as the Völsunga saga in Nordic traditions, and then in High German as the Nibelungenlied.</p>

<p>Both accounts differ from each other, and reflect the differences of the cultures they’re coming form, as well as the time they were written—the Völsunga saga is much raw and interlaced with Nordic Mythology, while the later German counterpart carries more of the courtly traditions of the late Middle Ages.</p>

<p>Something that both have in common is the presence of the magic ring which, along with a mythical treasure of the Nibelung clan, travels through many hands of heroes thirsty with greed.</p>

<p>Before Tolkien, these legends served as a base for works of two of his influences: William Morris and Richard Wagner. Morris wrote of the Volsunga: “This is the great story of the North, which should be to all our race what the tale of Troy was to the Greeks.” His The Story of Sigurd the Volsung and the Fall of the Niblungs has been reportedly read by Tolkien when he was a student. </p>

<p>In 1876, the same year that Morris’ translation was published, Richard Wagner premiered a cycle of four operas, called the The Ring of the Nibelung. It is often cited as the first expression of the identity of the then recently unified German nation.</p>

<p>Because of its strong Germanic themes, and the central role of the Ring of Power, clearly inspired by Wagner’s work, Lord of the Rings could be considered problematic. However, Tolkien sought to undo the damage done by Wagner’s repugnant ideology, and present the Northern spirit in its true light. </p>

<p>He updated the ring quest into the twentieth century by turning it on its head—instead of the ring being the ultimate goal by a mighty hero, it is destroyed. </p>

<p>Tolkien's influence can be seen far and wide. He even influenced the use of English itself, as nowadays we almost exclusively use the form &quot;dwarves&quot; as the plural for &quot;dwarf&quot;. Before the publication of <em>The Hobbit</em>, the common used form was &quot;dwarfs&quot;.

<h3>Rise of the Nerds</h3>

<p>Heavily inspired by Tolkien’s world, first board game, and then tabletop roleplaying game and its manual books, Dungeons and Dragons, has been released in 1974. The books outlined a fictional fantasy world, it’s lore and creatures, spells and character classes. The games had a fantasy setting imposed onto them, but they encouraged storytelling players, and creating their own personal characters. </p>

<p>“Herds of nerds” loved the game, but it was also called “the most effective introduction to the occult in the history of man”. 4. The fact that teenagers were fantasising about magic and swords sparked controversy in the USA, especially among Christian groups, such as B.A.D.D. (Bothered About Dungeons and Dragons).</p>

<p>As the Nuremberg Chronicle was printed at the very beginning of the printing press technology, the first Dungeons and Dragons books were printed in a period of great changes in the printing technologies, and the advent of digital publishing. That, added to their mass appeal goals, and references to European history allows us to see visual similarities between books of such different uses. </p>

<p>Recognising that my personal experience with ‘paper’ roleplaying games has been very sporadic, I thought that it would be best to have a talk with someone with better experience on the topic. I've thought about my friend Héloïse d'Almeida, a French graphic designer, who I remember being so dedicated to Dungeons and Dragons, that she was playing it with her friends through Skype (before it was the common way). While in Burgundy for the lockdown, she was kind enough to answer a few questions.</p>

<img src="IMAGES/D&D%20/Screenshot%202020-10-08%20at%2019.44.23.png" alt="" />
</figure>

<p>The interesting thing is that she has no teenage nostalgia towards RPGs—when I first met her a year and a half ago, she has been playing for only two months. She first got into it by accident, by looking for videos on YouTube that she could listen to while working, and the 4 hour-long podcasts of D&amp;D play sessions were perfect, as they didn't require constant concentration. After that initial interest, Heloise and her sisters found a group of players in their neighbourhood in Paris, that were meeting every week for sessions.</p>

<p>As Heloise puts it, the world setting of Dungeons and Dragons is &quot;European Middle Ages, as seen as Americans, that weren't there&quot;, where a millennia worth's of history has been playfully mixed into a single entity, with Dragons thrown on top. Seems about right. A big difference that she points out is the way language is used: as all items, spells, weapons, etc. have to be clearly understandable in the game, Latin is substituted for very simple and descriptive names. For example, a potion that increases the strength of your character would be called &quot;
Potion Of Giant Strength&quot;, as Giants are obviously very strong.</p>

<p>Something that helps in keeping the link to Medieval history, is the game's strong reliance on the book medium. Here, the book serves two purposes: as the rules grew more and more complex over time, it was the only possible way to collect all this information, pre-Internet era. But, with their suggestive illustrations and skeuomorphic graphics, the game manuals also sparked imagination, and made the player feel like they were shuffling through the manuscripts of old. While most of the game resources are now available online, which is great for accessibility, Heloise admits that it doesn't carry the same emotional load, and she still shares a set of books between her friends. Which she does as the books are expensive to buy, but it also reinforces the link between the playing group. And, its a refreshing thing to care for something so deeply with your friends, as a counter to the throw-away culture.</p>

<p>One set of books makes sense within roles that the players assume: one takes on the role of the Game (or Dungeon) Master, and others the roles of Player Characters. The Player Character is a single entity, that the player tries to role-play as, trying to imagine its personality, goals and decisions. As the games are mostly spoken, except for dice rolls and maps, the Dungeon Master takes care of the rest of the story: the narration, the world setting, the non-playable characters. </p>

<p>For Heloise, all of the complex and detailed combat rules, which can even detail up to a single inch what your character is doing, should only serve as a backdrop for the Game Master to create funny and interesting situations, an hour-long elaborate joke for the players to share, shared memories of things that didn't really happen. </p>

<p>In the aspect of character role-play, Heloise found that she prefers to play as characters which share some personality traits with her own – for example having a chaotic moral alignment, which often allows her to look for ways to bend the rules, which she says is similar to how she acts herself. On the other hand, playing as a lawful character proves to be too slow and confusing. (The rules of Dungeon and Dragons give the player a now well known chart of 9 moral alignments to choose from, with Good, Neutral, Evil on one axis, and Lawful, Neutral and Chaotic on the other. Two neutrals result in the True Neutral alignment). </p>

<p>Being on the other side of the Game Master screen, not only requires a great deal of preparation in the story and attention in keeping track of players actions, but can also be very unpredictable. Heloise clued me in how a Game Master can subtly direct the players by giving an illusion of choice, or leaving multiple clues towards one direction. On the other hand, the unpredictability is what sets the game apart – she mentioned a great moment, when, after being used more linear storylines, one realises what they can do with their characters is theoretically endless. </p>

<p>Combining the rise of the popularity of fantasy roleplaying games and miniature wargames, the company Games Workshop developed Warhammer Fantasy Battle, a wargame with richly described lore, with different races or factions as armies to choose from: some entirely fantastical, and some referencing history more closely, like Bretonnia, or The Empire. </p>

<p>A popular 1980’s cartoon, He-Man and the Masters of the Universe, was created to popularise and advertise the figures by Mattel toy company.</p>

<h3>Identity</h3>

<p>Past being in kindergarten, where Pokemon ruled, I didn’t have many common interest with other kinds when growing up. Not having much athletic talent, I wasn’t very interested in football. That, combined with growing up in a non-Christian household meant quite a bit of isolation being a kid in Poland. First discovering (classic) heavy metal music through my brother, and then fantasy books, and fantasy games, made me feeling like it was something of my own. Being 10, and living in the outskirts of Warsaw meant that life was good and there wasn’t much to rebel against, there wasn’t much of bad crowd to get mixed up with. Wearing a black t-shirt of SABBATH BLODDY SABBATH, with its hellish and sexually suggestive cover, not to mention the huge scull above ‘666’, was about the most rebellious thing I could do. Or so it seems in retrospect, back then it just mattered that the music and the visuals were super cool, and I that was a base for finding my own identity. </p>

<figure>
<img src="IMAGES/MUSIC/sabbathbloddy.jpg" alt="" />
</figure>

<p>In my early teenage days, Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion was a video game in which I’ve sunken a lot of hours. During cold and dark winter evenings, getting lost in a lush and magical world was very liberating. While nowadays I might not be so positive about the escapism nature of it, truth is that it gave a shy and reserved kid a sense of agency. Agency which at this point in video games evolved past a simple “rescue the princess” quest. However wonky it was, the game offered a closed, functioning ecosystem, with a big degree of freedom in character creation (for its time), and a “main” storyline which was not mandatory at all, save for a brief tutorial intro. I could follow it and save the world, but if I so wished, I could play as a giant lizard woman, crossing the realm with super jump potions and feeding its inhabitants poisoned apples. </p>

<p>The search for identity can also apply to whole countries. During the XIX century, Poland as a state was non-existed, its lands divided between neighbouring empires. That in turn made Polish-speaking artists search through history for moments that they could portray, to preserve the Polish identity intact. </p>

<p>Battle of Grunwald, painted by Jan Matejko, is an enormously huge painting, almost 0,5m by 1m, housed in the National Museum of Warsaw. It was always a crucial element of my visits in the museum, and it’s possible that’s where I get my love for working in big, overly saturated compositions.</p>

<p>Henryk Sienkiewicz was a prominent Polish author, who wrote novels in the Polish language at the end of the XIX century. After completing a trilogy of historical novels which dealt with the XVII in Poland, he wrote “The Knights of the Cross”, a historical novel dealing with the end of 12th century, and Polish conflict with the Teutonic Knights, one of Poland’s claims to glory. Because of its relevancy in portraying Poland winning over Germany, it was one of the first books to be printed in Poland after the Second World War, and it was made into a movie in 1960. To this day, medieval reconstructions of battles, especially the most famous battle of Grunwald, are being organised across the country. The castles build by the Teutonic Order, especially their biggest keep Malbork, are popular touristic destinations in the north of the country.

<p>Letters are like ancient tales of myths. We more or less know their forms, and can anticipate where they start, and where they finish, what is their moral. Each (latin-based) culture has their own version, while having a shared backbone. They seem to have origins too far away for us to grasp. While they seem to have been created already a long time ago (especially in the case of Roman capitals of the Trajan Column), they are in a state of constant transformation, perhaps the most intense in history, during the last 40 years, thanks to the availability of the personal computer. While there might exist an ephemeral “standard” form of the letter that we are striving to achieve, like spoken tales, each one of us can insert their own interpretations, both from the side of the reader and the writer (of the letter). Generally, the overarching trends and models of typefaces have changed, like languages, organically over long periods of time. But unlike language, the letters which are carriers of language were conjured by a few people at most, if not a single person. </p>

<p>A type designer that's well aware of these poetical qualities of letters, is Jules Durand (a.k.a LazyDog). In his masters video/type designer manifesto called &quot;a Tale of Type&quot;, he presents his &quot;family tree&quot; of meticulously drawn typefaces. Jules moves freely across historical models of letters, Arts &amp; Crafts revivals, and modern video games references. He calls his typefaces &quot;Typographic Revivance&quot; as opposed to Typographic Revivals: having a clear starting point in a historical typeface, but transforming them further to his own vision. </p>

<p>Technically, his typefaces are not different from, let's say, a contemporary neo-grotesque (Helvetica-like). They are drawn using the same computer software, approximated with the same logic of Bezier curves, and they are stored under the same .ttf/.otf file formats. However, they do <em>feel</em> different. </p>

<figcaption>A Tale of Type</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>On the form level, Durand employs a much bigger level of intricacy in the shapes. As he himself puts it, the qualities he looks for in typefaces are: &quot;ornamentation, exuberance &amp; refinement&quot;. On the level of presentation, by talking about typographical alchemy, showing interfaces of fantasy video games and magical 3D renders, he creates a deeper context for his letters. By tapping into the collective imagination on these morphologies, he creates an atmosphere of deeper history. Despite showing all his cards, the power of suggestion of the letter shapes and the visuals the combines them with upkeeps the suspension of disbelief. </p>

<p>Roland Barthes in his collection of essays <em>Mythologies</em> describes the way that fringes of Ancient Rome are used as <em>signs</em> in Joseph Mankiewicz's movie <em>Julius Caesar</em>. Through all film, actors bear a &quot;little flag displayed on their foreheads&quot;, keeping up at all times the historical plausibility. </p>

<p>In media dealing with the medieval and the medieval fantasy, we can observe a lot of such similar signs: horses, knight equipment, castles, etc. If enough of them are present, the suspension of disbelief is kept up, the magic happens. </p>

<p>Few were more aware of these signifiers than the British comedy group Monty Python. In their film <em>Monty Python and the Holy Grail</em> they break the 4th wall in almost every scene, constantly exposing and mocking the art of cinema. In many cases, they have turned their film budget limitations into jokes – the most famous one being the usage of coconuts, in lieu of horse riding. Their play with theatrics of cinema, and the humorous awareness of the medium is incredible. As usual with Python productions, most of the characters that have dialogue are portrayed by one of the five members of the six-person group (sans Terry Gilliam). It's not uncommon for the same actor to play two different roles during a scene. Right from the start, they subvert the accuracy of the historical setting – the coconuts become a starting point of a discussion about air-speed velocity of African swallows. Later on, King Arthur comes across a pair of subjects, which look the part of medieval, plague disfigured peasant, but they question his kingly authority as a dictatorship, &quot;a self-perpetuating autocracy&quot; and claim to be living in a anarcho-syndicalist commune. About one-third into the movie, a &quot;famous historian&quot; shooting a documentary, but at the same time narrating the plot so far, is killed by one of the knights, leading to the anti-climax ending, where King Arthur is arrested by the British Police. </p>

<p>How is the illusion kept? How despite all of this, despite the actors literally prancing about with their hands up in the air holding invisible reins, was I still 100% sure that I was watching a part of an Arthurian legend? The power of suggestion is so strong, that after each joke that breaks the illusion, within 10 seconds back in the action, the adventure continued.</p>

<p>After the opening credits roll by, the film starts. The triumphant trumpets and harps reminiscent of court musicians announce the coming adventure. The Lombardic-like letters set the time and place: England, 932 A.D. Then, fog, a skeleton tied to a wooden pole, and a sound of horse's hooves (or so we think). Before subverting the cliches, they create such a fool-proof setting, they can always fall back into it, no matter how far they stray from it.</p>

</figure>

<p>Relying on such cliches and assumptions can also lead to very questionable results. In the 1981 animated movie <em>Heavy Metal</em>, based on stories from a legendary magazine of the same title, the characters are so unbelievably cliched, it becomes hilarious to watch today. The trope of the damsel in distress is very bluntly expressed visually – all of the female characters through out the movie, of course helpless and passive, have large breasts and are constantly sexually aroused. During the last, iconic segment, a female warrior Taarna takes the spotlight. We can immediately tell that she has a hero status, not only because of her wielding a sword and riding a giant bird, but also because of her considerably smaller cleavage.</p>

<h1>Part 3: The Abstraction</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>“We might conclude that, if the human experiment was aimed at the expanding the sphere of rationality and reducing chaos, the human experiment is over. The very tools that enabled the expansion of rationality and human control (science, technology, industry, and information) have subsumed life to abstraction. And living warmth can only be found outside the icy walls of the citadel of reason.” F. Bernardi </p>

<p>It seems to me that we find ourselves beyond the stage of Monty Python's subverting and playing with established cliches. The associations about Middle Ages are still there, but the excess of information overloads the meaning – the historical imagery is remixed into a memetic purgatory.</p>

<h3>Algorithmic Storytelling</h3>

<p>Because D&amp;D and subsequent fantasy games started gaining popularity in the USA and then rest of the world in the 1980s, they were a perfect inspiration for the developing market of video games, mainly home console and computer games. Whereas ‘classical’ paper and pen roleplaying games required free-form, abstract thinking from its players, the computer ones focused more on structure and logic.</p>

<p>AI Generated RPG: https://play.aidungeon.io/main/landing</p>

<p>“AI Dungeon by Latitude is a first of its kind AI generated text adventure.Using a massive natural language AI model (and an even more massive one if you're on the Dragon model), AI Dungeon generates the story and results of your actions as you play in this virtual world. Unlike virtually every other game in existence, you are not limited by the imagination of the
developer in what you can do. Any thing you can express in language can be your action and the AI dungeon master will decide how the world responds.”</p>

<p>In the dungeon manager simulator, <em>Dwarf Fortress</em> players start the game by creating a world. Simulation runs, every time randomly generating geography, history, etc through the passage of time. What took Tolkien his whole creative life, here can be generated in just a few seconds.

<h3>MODERN EXAMPLES</h3>

<p>Wanting to end the text on a contemporary note, I thought to contact another friend of mine – Laura Nicholson, an artist based in London. Not only do they live and breathe art theory, which proved to be helpful in legitimising my arguments, but what also came to my mind are the fantasy motifs that they use in their insanely detailed and satisfying to watch work. </p>

<figure>
<img src="IMAGES/FANTASY%20ARTISTS/NICHOLSON_LAURA/Screenshot%202020-12-02%20at%2010.17.58.png" alt="A linocut by Laura" />
<figcaption>A linocut by Laura</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Knowing that Laura comes from the USA, but then studied and lived for some time now in England, I thought it would be a good opportunity to check how much of my assumptions could be only limited to Northern Europe. What I didn't expect is that as a kid, Laura was going to &quot;really, really rural Ireland&quot; every summer, where they could see things that predate written history, that European mythology rests on something &quot;other&quot;.</p>

<p>Literary classic like the King Arthur tales were also present, and the Brother Grimm tales were the first thing that their mother read to them – which later made Disney movies shocking, as no one had their feet cut off, and there was no blood.</p>

<p>For Laura, these tales harked back to something more solid than what they could find in the America, because of it being &quot;deeply ahistorical&quot;. However, Europeanness was not something in and of itself, but a valuableness that came from it being non-American.
Coming back to America and declaring &quot;I JUST CAME FROM EUROPE&quot; was an identity within the American one. Laura's interest in Europe's history wasn't so much because it was European, but because it was older. As Native American history has been annihilated, the only way to get a sense of things happening over time in the flow of them, is to go to Europe. Europe is where history happens for America. </p>

<p>The idea of Europe also allowed for reflection on the harshness of the American capitalism, it was the dangerous and kinky place where communism might be possible. (Laura admits that one of their first drawings were big titted women with huge communist symbols, as it was something exotic.) </p>

<figure>
<img src="IMAGES/FANTASY%20ARTISTS/NICHOLSON_LAURA/Screenshot%202020-12-02%20at%2010.17.36.png" alt="A linocut by Laura" />
<figcaption>A linocut by Laura</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>When asked about the fantasy themes in their art, Laura acknowledges that part of it is personal and part of it is just they enjoy drawing, and she might not find the rational for it until years after it had been drawn.</p>

<p>Otherwise, a lot of the stuff comes from around mirror neurons and the idea that you will project yourself or be easily find yourself in relation to the human body. They always try to work with images that people can find themselves in relation to, and then play with those images. They like to combine porn with surgery videos, with popular culture coming into a mix that is hopefully nausea inducing. And it has to be recognisable for it to be nausea inducing, to feel strange. Because if it's too strange, then it's just strange. Most of it is informed by the combination of comic books and traditional painting, mixed in with techniques based on the body.</p>

</figure>

<p>When I pointed out how precise Laura was, in contrast to the vague question I have asked, I got back a classic quote: &quot;I have to have a lot of precision, because I am a mess.&quot; </p>
